- S**hifting the Activation Function** (IMPORTANT): Without the bias term, the output would always be forced to pass through the origin when all inputs are zero. The bias allows the activation function to shift horizontally, providing more flexibility. For instance, with the bias, the network can model inputs that don't pass through the origin, giving the network the ability to fit more complex patterns.

- Controlling Output: The bias term helps control the output of the neuron, even when the input values are zero. It helps in adjusting the decision boundary in classification tasks, or shifts the regression line up or down in regression tasks.

- Improving Training: Bias helps improve training by enabling the neuron to activate even when the inputs are not sufficient by themselves. In this way, the bias helps neurons activate more easily and makes learning faster.

- Increased Model Flexibility: By adding a bias, the neural network is capable of learning more complex patterns, as the bias compensates for cases where the input values alone would not be able to provide the desired output.
