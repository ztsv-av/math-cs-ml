# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning - algorithms that learn input to output mapping (Input(X) -> Output(Y)). In this type of learning, you give your algorithm examples to learn from that include correct labels for a particular input. For example, you might provide your algorithm with AD and USER INFO data and get CLICK (0/1) probability (used in online advertising).

## Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms

- Regression: the task is to predict a number based on some input. For example, predicting house price based on its size. In regression, there are infinetely many possible outputs.

- Classification: the task is to classify, predict a label, category of something. For example, predicting whether a tumor is malignant type1 (1), malignant type2 (2) or benign (0) based on its diameter and age of a patient. Classification predicts small, finity number of possible outputs.
