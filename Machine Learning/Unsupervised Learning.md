# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning - in this type of learning, we are given data that is not associated with any output labels Y. The job here is to find some structure, patterns, or just something interesting about the unlabeled data.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

- Clustering: grouping data into groups or clusters based on how similar each item (such as a hospital patient or shopping customer) are to each other. A clustering algorithm looks at a number of data points and automatically finds data points that are related or similar to each other. For example, grouping news articles into same groups based on their titles, or DNA analysis, groping people with same traits. To group space bodies into groups together, people use clustering to perform astronomical data analysis.

- Anomaly detection: find unusual data points. For example, finding unusual transactions (frauds) in banking systems.

- Dimensionality reduction: compress data using fewer numbers, i.e. reduce the dimension of the dataset.
