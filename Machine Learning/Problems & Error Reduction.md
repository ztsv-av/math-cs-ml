# Problems & Error Reduction

Try different techniques to reduce overall cost of your model and iterate through ML Development Loop using new methods/parameters at a time.

## Spam Classifier

Some methods to reduce cost include:

- collect more data, e.g. "Honeypot" project (when high variance);
- develop sophisticated features based on email routing (from email hearder) (build separate model?);
- define sophisticated features from email body. For instance, should 'discounting' and 'discount' be treated as the same word?
- design algorithms to detect misspellings, such as 'w4tches', 'med1cine', m0rtgate', etc.
