# ML Development Loop

1. Define project scope.
2. Define and collect data.
3. Choose architecture (model, data, etc.).
4. Train model.
5. Diagnostics (bias, variance, error analysis).
6. Iterative improvement: go back to step 2 using new parameters/data.
7. Deploy in production, maintain system.

## Deployment Cycle

Make sure that your machine learning model is reliable, scales well, has good laws, is monitored, and then you have the opportunity to make updates to the model as appropriate to keep it running well.
