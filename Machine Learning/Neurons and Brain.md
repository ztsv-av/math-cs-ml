# Neurons and Brain

The first goal of machine learning algorithms was to mimic neurons in the human brain.

In human brain, neurons receive information as electrical impulses through dendrites from other neurons. A neuron carries out some computations and will then send its output to other neuron as an electrical impulse through axon. The receiver neuron will accept many outputs from other neurons as inputs and will then continue computation cycle.

The biological neuron consists of a nucleus (cell body), dendrites (wires from which it receives inputs) and axon (output wire).
