# Artificial Intelligence

There are two types of AI: **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)** and **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**.

## Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

This is an AI system that does one thing, a narrow task, sometimes really well and can be incredibly valuable, such as the smart speaker or self-driving car or web search, or AI applied to specific applications such as farming or factories. Over the last several years, ANI has made tremendous progress and it's creating, as you know, tremendous value in the world today.

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

AGI is a system that could do anything a typical human can do. Despite all the progress in ANI and therefore tremendous progress in AI, people sure how much progress, if any, we're really making toward AGI. However, there have been a variety of experiments showing that the human brain is amazingly adaptable, or, as neuroscientists say, amazingly plastict. Human brain is able to deal with bewildering range of sensor inputs. So, the question is, if the same piece of brain tissue can learn to see, or touch, or feel, or even other things, what is the algorithm it uses, and can we replicate this algorithm and implemented in a computer? This is the goal of AGI.
