# Convex

A function $x \in \R \to f(x) \in \R$ is said to be *convex* if:

$f(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) < \theta f(x) + (1 - \theta)f(y), \forall \theta \in [0,1]$ and $\forall x, y \in \R$

In other words, $\forall x$ and $y \in \R$ the graph of the function $f$ between the points $(x, f(x))$ and $(y, f(y))$ lies below the chord that connects these two points.
