Linear regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable Y and one or more independent variables X. In simple linear regression, we use one independent variable to predict the dependent variable, while in multiple linear regression, we use two or more independent variables.

The basic idea of linear regression is to find the line (in simple linear regression) or hyperplane (in multiple linear regression) that best fits the data, by minimizing the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.

The equation for simple linear regression is:

$$Y = b_0 + b_1X$$

where $Y$ is the dependent variable, $X$ is the independent variable, $b_0$ is the intercept or constant term, and $b_1$ is the regression coefficient or slope.

The regression coefficient $b_1$ represents the change in $Y$ for a one-unit increase in $X$. In other words, it represents the amount by which the dependent variable $Y$ changes for a one-unit increase in the independent variable $X$. The sign of the regression coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between the two variables (i.e., positive if they are positively related, negative if they are negatively related).

In multiple linear regression, we have multiple independent variables and the equation becomes:

$$Y = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + ... + b_nx_n$$

where $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are the independent variables, and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ are the regression coefficients.

The regression coefficients in multiple linear regression represent the change in Y for a one-unit increase in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other independent variables constant. The coefficients can be used to analyze the strength and direction of the relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables, and to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

## Example

You have performed a linear regression analysis to explore sunflowers’ growth (in meters per month)
depending on the watering (in litres per day). You have estimated the regression coefficient to be $β = 1.6$. 

Judging from the regression coefficient, we can say that:
- If you give it an additional litre of water per day, there will be an additional average growth of 1.6 meters per month.
- According to the model assumptions, an additional litre of water per day will result in additional 19.2 meters of growth after one year.
- We should consider further influencing quantities, since 19.2 meters of growth after one year is unrealistic. These quantities might be, e.g., the month of a year.
