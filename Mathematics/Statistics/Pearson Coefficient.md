# Pearson Coefficient

The Pearson correlation coefficient, also called Pearson's r or the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two continuous variables.

The Pearson coefficient is calculated as the covariance between the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The formula for the Pearson coefficient is:

$$r = \frac{cov(X, Y)}{\sigma X * \sigma Y}$$

, where:

- $r$ is the Pearson correlation coefficient
- $cov(X,Y)$ is the covariance between X and Y
- $\sigma X$ is the standard deviation of X
- $\sigma Y$ is the standard deviation of Y

The Pearson coefficient can range from -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfectly negative linear relationship, a correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship, and a correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfectly positive linear relationship.
