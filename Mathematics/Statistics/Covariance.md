Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates the degree to which two variables are linearly associated. It measures how much the two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase when the other decreases.

The formula for covariance is:

$$cov(X,Y) = \frac{\sum[(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})]}{n - 1}$$

where:

- $cov(X,Y)$ is the covariance between X and Y
- $\sum$ is the sum of
- $x_i$ is the ith observation in the X dataset
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean of X
- $y_i$ is the ith observation in the Y dataset
- $\bar{y}$ is the mean of Y
- $n$ is the number of observations in the datasets

To compute covariance, follow these steps:

1. Collect the data for the two variables you want to analyze.

1. Calculate the mean (average) for each variable.

1. Subtract the mean of each variable from its corresponding observations.

1. Multiply the differences you obtained in step 3, for each pair of observations. In other words, multiply the difference between each X observation and its mean by the difference between each Y observation and its mean.

1. Add up the products obtained in step 4.

1. Divide the result from step 5 by (n-1), where n is the number of observations in the datasets.

The resulting value is the covariance between the two variables. If the covariance is positive, the variables tend to move in the same direction, while if the covariance is negative, the variables tend to move in opposite directions. A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear association between the variables.
