Expected value, also known as the mean or average, is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that represents the long-term average value of a random variable. It is a measure of the central tendency of a probability distribution.

The expected value of a discrete random variable X is calculated as the sum of the product of each possible value of X and its probability, and can be represented by the formula:

$$E[X] = \sum x_i * P(X = x_i)$$

where $x_i$ represents the possible values of $X$ and $P(X = x_i)$ is the probability of $X$ taking the value $x_i$.

For a continuous random variable $X$ with probability density function $f(x)$, the expected value is calculated as the integral of the product of each possible value of $X$ and its probability density function $f(x)$, and can be represented by the formula:

$$E[X] = \int xf(x) dx$$

The expected value is a useful tool for making predictions and analyzing the properties of probability distributions. It can be used to calculate the mean of a sample, estimate future outcomes, and compare the relative desirability of different outcomes.

## How to calculate the expected value given probability density function?

To calculate the expected value (or mean) of a continuous random variable $X$ with probability density function $f(x)$, we use the following formula:

$E[X] = \int xf(x) dx$

where the integral is taken over the range of possible values of $X$. In other words, we multiply each possible value of $X$ by its probability density function $f(x)$, and integrate over all possible values of $X$.

For example, suppose we have a continuous random variable $X$ with probability density function $f(x) = 2x$ for $0 ≤ x ≤ 1$. To find the expected value of $X$, we use the formula:

$E[X] = \int xf(x) dx = \int ^1_0 x2x dx$

$[\frac{2}{3}x^3]^1_0 = \frac{2 * 1}{3} - \frac{2 * 0}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$

## How to calculate the probability of X taking on values within a specific range given probability density function?

To calculate the probability of a continuous random variable X taking on values within a specific range, we need to integrate the probability density function f(x) over that range.

For example, suppose we have a continuous random variable X with probability density function:

$f(x) = 1/4$, for $0 < x < 4$

To calculate the probability that X takes on values between 1 and 3, we need to integrate the probability density function over that range:

$P(1 ≤ X ≤ 3) = \int ^3_1 f(x) dx$

= $\int ^3_1 1/4 dx$

= $[x/4]^3_1$

= $\frac{3}{4} -\frac{1}{4}$

= $\frac{1}{2}$

## What is the probability of X at a point?

The probability of a continuous random variable X taking on a specific point or value is zero, since the probability of X taking on any specific value in a continuous distribution is infinitesimally small. This is because the probability density function (PDF) of a continuous random variable measures the relative likelihood of X taking on values within a range, not at a specific point.

However, we can still calculate the probability of X being within a small range around a specific point. Specifically, the probability of X being within a range (a, b) around a specific point x can be calculated by integrating the probability density function f(x) over that range. This represents the probability that X falls within the range (a, b), which includes the specific point x. However, the probability of X being exactly equal to x is zero, since the probability of X taking on any specific value in a continuous distribution is infinitesimally small.
