# Methodologies

Software development projects all have their own unique goals and constraints. Business objectives must also be applied to the project to ensure the outcome meets the business goals as well as the functional goals. The following will show how these factors and others are used to help the most suitable software development methodology for a particular project.

## Candidates

Various approaches can be taken to software development, and some are more common than others. Typical methodologies include the following:

- Traditional (e.g. Waterfall Model, Incremental, and Spiral methods)
- Agile (e.g. Scrum, Crystal, Adaptive, Feature-Driven, and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Extreme Programming (XP))

Main methodoligies in use today are:
- Agile Software Development Methodology
- DevOps Methodology
- Scrum Development Methodology
- Waterfall Model
- Prototype Methodology
- Feature Driven Development
- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- Spiral Model
- Dynamic Systems Development Model Methodology
- Extreme Programming Methodology
- Joint Application Development Methodology
- Lean Development Methodology
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Crystal Methodologies
- Kanban Methodology

## Analysis

The first step in the selection process is to determine the project objectives, constraints, and goals. Other factors such as the preliminary project schedule, functionality, and customer requirements should also be examined at this stage.

Business maturity, particularly the maturity of the development resources, must be reviewed to determine what kinds of methodologies are suitable for the people involved. Inexperience in software development (in general) and in the development of complex projects within an organization (in particular) will limit the types of methodologies that will work well for a specific project.

Some decision factors are more obvious than others, but ultimately, the methodology should align with the nature of the project. Some projects are more stable than others, and the business may or may not be in a hurry to complete the project. The project may be for a short-lived system, or it may need to support long-term business operations. The code base may be complex, and flexibility may be required for later updates.

Only when armed with this information might a project analyst properly analyze and select a methodology.

## Selection

To begin the selection process, accumulate all of the information acquired in the analysis step in a decision matrix with the important factors listed first as decision criteria. Next, add each methodology identified as a candidate and note the suitability of each methodology for every decision factor. The most appropriate methodology should be apparent.

The most important factor in the decision is to make sure the project is done with a quality level that matches the business needs. Development resources should be used efficiently. Other parts of the business should not be negatively impacted by the development effort.

Another way to look at the selection of a methodology is to minimize risk. Every project has associated risks that may impact the business or client. Too much time on a project might be a negative if a business needs the new system to enhance competitiveness or reduce operational costs. For some businesses, such as banks, quality control and security may be more important than speedy delivery of an application.

It may be tempting to select the latest in development methodologies as they come to the forefront and receive good press. The Agile methods do make some presumptions, however. If the development team is experienced, then the risk in the development phase will not be on the code but more on the communication and organizational issues, which are lower risk. If the business has repeatedly experienced problems in the software life cycles, then a traditional methodology such as waterfall might be more suitable while processes are established in a repeatable fashion.

The choice of a suitable development methodology depends on the project, the resources, and the business. Proper identification of the goals and risks of a project along with a well-defined decision matrix can help make the selection process easier.

### Traditional

The traditional method uses a linear approach where the stages of the software development process must be completed in sequential order. This means that a stage must be completed before the next one begins. These stages usually comprise the following:

1. Requirements gathering and documentation
2. System design
3. Code and unit testing
4. System testing
5. User acceptance testing
6. Bug fixes
7. Product delivery

#### Waterfall Development

The waterfall development strategy is characterized by a rigid adherence to the project management outlines. The strategy takes the project charter, requirements, scope document, and work breakdown structure and moves forward deliberately and rigidly according to the outline these documents establish.

For example, let's imagine that a design firm is given the task of creating lessons for a nonprofit literacy program. The literacy program initially approaches the design firm because it wants to reach a wider audience than it could by soliciting volunteers to help its constituents on a one-on-one basis. While we will not outline the full details of the literacy program's project, let's just postulate that the literacy program has determined that key needs of the program are ten successive, three-minute multimedia exercises in grammar and composition. 

Let's further assume that the project charter schedules the delivery of one module each week for ten weeks. So what does the design firm need to manage this kind of project? The firm needs scripts from subject matter experts—in this case, experts in grammar and composition—who will provide the foundation for the design firm's instructional and graphic designers to craft interactive and compelling presentations. The design firm therefore needs the following: a project manager to recruit subject matter experts and oversee the successful completion of the modules, instructional designers to work with the subject matter experts and to craft their unpredictable scripts into the interactive modules, and capable graphic designers with expertise in multimedia design. The design firm may also need narrators and an abundance of resources (physical and human) to streamline the workflow and provide valuable expertise.

Under a waterfall development model, the design firm will sketch out deadlines and establish a procedure of completing the projects and stick to this procedure. It might determine that, in the case of the literacy center's project, because there are ten individual, yet successive, design modules, it will begin with the first module. When the first multimedia module is complete, it will proceed to the second. And when the second module is complete, it will proceed then onto the third, and so on until all ten have been completed. The term waterfall comes about because each module leads to the next.

This model is common in software development. It usually starts by identifying requirements, then proceeds to design and development, then proceeds to testing, and finally winds up in testing. It is iterative. This means that each step builds on the previous steps.

The effectiveness of this strategy derives from the belief that time spent up front, that is planning the project through identifying requirements and creating rigid schedules for development, is time well spent: problems encountered along the way are easier to account for if they have been identified up-front. By making sure that each phase of the project is done correctly before proceeding to the next ensures that the project will be a success, thus the waterfall development approach is very disciplined. In theory, when early stages of the planning and execution are completed successfully, they will ensure a strong foundation of success in the subsequent stage.

There are, however, arguments that the waterfall model is not always ideal in practice, because no project can foresee every obstacle nor plan for any potential obstacle. In practice, subsequent stages often encounter obstacles that require the developers to revisit earlier stages and make changes. In the literacy example, consider the possibility that the project management team outlined the contents of each of the multimedia learning modules and determined that the first module would discuss adjectives and adverbs. The team planned, in the second module, to discuss nouns and verbs. But then the team realizes it made a mistake in the initial plan: it could not adequately address the subject of adjectives and adverbs without first addressing nouns and verbs! Perhaps that example is obvious and would never have been planned that way, but there are exceptions. (One example is that NASA's Mars Lander did function properly because some calculations were programmed in metric units, and others in English units).

Another way of describing waterfall development is top-down. The project proceeds linearly from beginning to end. One part leads to the next. Phases of the design are done sequentially.

- Works well with well defined requirements
- Works well with a defined architecture.
- Can work well with an experienced development staff
- Can require intense documentation
- Depends on accurately defining all the requirements up front

### Agile

- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Scrum
- Agile Modeling
- Adaptive Software Development (ASD)
- Crystal Methodologies
- Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
- Feature Driven Development (FDD)
- Lean software development
- Agile Unified Process (AUP)

**Agile** software methods have gained notoriety as being low-overhead and sometimes as being low-documentation. The low-documentation label is somewhat erroneous because there is documentation involved in agile methods. Agile methodologies aim to reduce overhead in areas of rationale, justification, documentation, reports, meetings, and permission. The big distinction between agile methods and other methods is to do enough and then stop. This may mean skipping documentation that is traditionally completed.

Agile methodologies accept that software development is difficult to control and manage this risk by aiming to deliver smaller units. The work teams may be as small as two to three people, and the cycle may be as short as a week. The agile process focuses on values as opposed to processes. Like most iterative methodologies, most aspects of the project, including the budget and timeline, are reviewed at the end of each cycle.

#### Extreme Programming

**Extreme Programming, or XP**, is a popular agile methodology. The core values that XP focuses on are communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. Communication takes the form of programmers working in pairs and having a stakeholder present at all times to clarify and answer questions. Simplicity comes from building only the solution that is needed today and worrying less about future extensibility.

Feedback is a continuously running way to manage the development process. Continual integration, collective ownership, pair programming, and growing test cases are examples of feedback loops. Courage relates to allowing the ingenuity of the people on the project to be utilized.

#### The Crystal Family

The Crystal family of methodologies is named for geologic crystals. As in the geologic object, the colors you sometimes hear associated with the methodology (such as Crystal Clear and Crystal Orange) are an indication of the method’s (or crystal’s) hardness. The values behind Crystal methodologies emphasize frequent delivery, close communication, and reflective improvement. Crystal methodologies are adjusted to fit the encountered scenario. This is the reflective improvement and can happen during the project as participants discover what is working for them and what is not. The aspects that are not working are discarded and other ideas are tried. The communication in Crystal is called osmotic communication. This is usually achieved by seating people on the same team in the same room. This way they can overhear conversations among other team members and participate in or learn from those conversations as they have time. Crystal teams aim to produce small releases of software that are useful and actually used. Teams are usually two to eight people.

### Spiral

- Is a risk-oriented life cycle
- Breaks a large project in mini projects
- Is considered an iterative life cycle
- Provides controls through checkpoints at the end of each iteration
- Can be combined with other lifecycles, such as a waterfall life cycle
- Risks that can be addressed by the spiral life cycle include poorly understood requirements or architecture

### Evolutionary Prototyping

- Developers and customers work together to develop prototypes
- Shows steady signs of progress throughout the project
- Can be difficult to predict how long the product development will take
- Provides flexibility for rapidly changing requirements
- Staged Delivery
- Delivers the product in stages
- Uses the waterfall methodology for concept development, analysis, and architectural design
- Requires careful planning and management
- Customer sees software after each stage
- The final product is known throughout the project, it is developed in stages

### Design to Schedule

- Product is developed in stages
- Stages are prioritized, so that the highest priority work can be done first
- The stages are planned to meet a specific deadline
- Some of the product may never be developed or implemented

### Code and Fix

- Used for tiny, throw-away projects
- Does not require time spend on any of the lifecycle activities except coding
- Does not require project management or methodology expertise
- Does not address quality

### Scrum

Scrum is an agile software development methodology particularly well-suited to a project that must be flexible to account for changing requirements during the development process. The company in question is working toward implementation of a new version of its flagship product, but there are many forces influencing the requirements as the project progresses. Additionally, the development team is comprised of smaller groups in geographically separate places, which creates a need for more independent development methodologies. Scrum was deemed to be an ideal methodology to account for these demands. 

#### The Pieces 

The Scrum focuses on relatively short-development phases called sprints. Sprints are comprised of definitions of product functionality with the important requirement that each sprint ends with a demonstrable deliverable. Sprints are also restricted to relatively short time frames of three to four weeks. Each sprint is comprised of user stories that describe specific implementations of the product functionality. Within user stories are tasks that specify the lower-level implementation details. Tasks each have time estimates, but more importantly, the user stories have delivery dates within the sprints. 

#### The Systems 

Proper systems are required to track all of the details required for management of Scrum-based projects. In addition to the typical document and code management, Scrum projects require a special type of software geared toward management of sprints, user stories, and sprint tasks. The details of Scrum projects are stored and presented hierarchically. It is important to have a variety of options for searching and sorting these data, so an accurate picture of the project and task status can be obtained at any time. 

#### The Problems 

There are some typical problems that occur in the implementation of the Scrum methodology. One of the most common problems is the lack of experience using this methodology. Most development teams are accustomed to a broader, serialized approach, such as the waterfall methodology. The required fast response to changing requirements often puts the development team in an uncomfortable situation. Proper training is a vital aspect of successful Scrum implementations. 

Another problem encountered in Scrum is the tendency of the development team to revert to older methods. One of the major tenets of Scrum is to define achievable, smaller deliverables, and then deliver them on time. By reducing the time frame on the deliverables, the ability of the team to accomplish its goals is raised. However, often when the first sign of trouble occurs, the tendency is to push tasks out to future sprints. The correct approach is fast identification of potential problems and immediate action to resolve the issues so the sprint deadlines can still be achieved. 

#### The Solutions 

Training is a key issue when a company makes the decision to move to Scrum or any other new development methodology. When the team understands the process and the goals, they are more likely to follow the process and not introduce additional problems by deviating from the established process. 

Proper management is another vital component in the Scrum process. Scrum masters are leaders of the Scrum teams. These positions are responsible for the day-to-day activities of the Scrum teams. Daily meetings are held with the Scrum teams to discuss the issues, tasks, and timelines. These frequent meetings help identify problems as early as possible and reduce the impact of these problems. 

The small Scrum teams must have excellent cooperation and communication. Cooperation comes from the elimination of any influences that may cause competition or mistrust between the team members. Management can help by offering incentives to the group as a whole and not to individuals. Team members must be encouraged to share their ideas, skills, and knowledge.
