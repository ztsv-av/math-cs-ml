# Systems Engineering Models

Many systems engineering models have been developed over the past several decades. As the technology and the needs of the systems engineering industry have changed, so have the models. This presentation will provide an overview of some of the most popular models. The types of projects the models fit will also be reviewed. 

## What is a systems engineering model? 

Systems engineering models are not the same as development methodologies. This is a common misunderstanding when processes like the waterfall or spiral methodology are used as an overall model for systems development. Systems engineering models represent the entire process of product life cycles, from inception to disposal, while development methodologies focus on the specific tasks required to create a product. A review of some of the more popular systems engineering models will help with the understanding of these models. 

## INCOSE Model 

The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) developed a model that focuses on the development of requirements early in the process. Customers are given special consideration as stakeholders in the design and functionality of the systems. INCOSE believes that well-documented and thorough functional requirements will reduce problems later in the process. The INCOSE model provides well-defined processes for requirements elicitation and technical management of the development processes. 

## VEE Model 

The VEE model works from a series of baselines for various steps of the systems engineering process. Each baseline starts with a plan to be considered. Each plan is revised and reviewed again, adding a more detailed layer to the original baseline plan each time. Eventually, an approved plan is created for the stage of engineering in question. 

## Tuft’s Model 

Tuft’s model is a more detailed model that includes details for the implementation of the various stages of systems engineering. These details include the capture of business and marketing information and include project management, requirements and architecture, product design and development, systems integration, testing, deployment, and finally, operations and maintenance. The details provided by Tufts model in each of the categories are helpful in complex systems engineering projects that are going through all the life cycle phases. 

## Plowman’s Model 

Plowman’s model, like Tuft’s model, is suitable for complex systems engineering projects because it provides a high level of detail in the plans for each step of the systems' life cycle. This model begins with the customer and focuses on requirements and solutions to defined problems. Methods for solution selection are provided in the model. These methods are useful for projects in which multiple solutions might be available. Steps are also taken to verify the preferred solution prior to actual development, so the Plowman’s model helps to reduce risk in a potentially expensive project. 

## CMMI 

The Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) is an extensive model that focuses on a larger measure of the stage of a company in its growth as a systems developer. CMMI provides details at the project level but also measures maturity for the aggregated projects. Companies that adopt CMMI are able to make growth in their processes over larger spans of time and multiple projects. 

## Agile  

As mentioned previously, Agile is not a systems engineering model, but Agile methods are often utilized in all of the models. The topic is worth consideration in a discussion of any model. Agile methods attempt to build project plans that focus on short-term deliverables with high quality. A focus is placed on accurate designs and a quick response to changing requirements. The main concept behind Agile methods is to avoid the problems that arise from the commitment to too many interrelated deliverables. With too many commitments, small changes in requirements or elsewhere in the project plan can disrupt the entire project. With Agile methods, the effects of changes are constrained to a smaller section of the project, and overall progress can be more efficient. 

## Summary 

This presentation provided a summary of some of the popular models used for systems engineering projects. These are not all the models in existence, but they provide a glimpse of the kinds of models in use today.
