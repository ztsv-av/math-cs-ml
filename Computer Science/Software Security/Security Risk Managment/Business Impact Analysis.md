# Business Impact Analysis

A business impact analysis (BIA) predicts the impact of disruption to business functions, then processes and assembles information required to develop and implement recovery strategies. To do this, an organization needs to determine the adverse impact resulting from a successful exploitation of vulnerability. To start the impact analysis, companies should collect the following information: Possible loss scenarios should be identified during a risk assessment. There are numerous possible scenarios that should be considered. 

This information can be found from existing organizational documentation, such as the business impact analysis report or criticality assessment report.  A business impact analysis report prioritizes the impact levels associated with the compromise of an organizationâ€™s information assets based on a quantitative or qualitative assessment of the criticality and sensitivity of those assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and prioritizes the critical and sensitive organization information assets (i.e., software, hardware, systems, services, and associated technology assets) that support the organization's critical missions. A recovery time objective (RTO) is the maximum allowable time length that a network, computer system, or application can be down after a disaster or failure occurs.

Determining how resources are allocated to resume business functions is a top goal of a BIA; this is called prioritization. By ranking different business functions, the items that need to be restored first can be identified and have the most resources allocated to them. Business functions depend on many resources (assets) to include people, technology, facilities, equipment, other functions, and suppliers. The order in which those operations are resumed, and their reliant resources made available, is key to the resumption of business operations and processes. Identifying the critical resources that each business function relies on should be an outcome of the business impact analysis (BIA) process.
