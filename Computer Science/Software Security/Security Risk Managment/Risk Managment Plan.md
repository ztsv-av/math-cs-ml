# Risk Managment Plan

The risk management plan is a comprehensive deliverable comprised of risks, assessment results, and response plans. It can exist as a stand-alone document, a series of smaller documents, or it can be incorporated into the overall project plan. The format you choose depends on the intensity level of your project, the formality that is expected from a project manager, and the volume of documented risks. The plan may be shared as a presentation, a narrative, or a simple conversation. The format of the risk management plan is not critical—the content is.

The risk management plan should document the following items:

- Risk management approach: This is a description of the methodology that was used for the identification and assessment of all risks. It should describe the risk tolerance levels that were assumed and the risk analysis methods that were used.
- Risk lists: These are prioritized lists of risks by risk score or by probability or impact. This may include the probability/impact matrix or just a description of the findings. High and medium priority risks should be identified explicitly.
- Risk strategies: These are descriptions of the risk prevention, impact reduction, and response planning actions for each risk that was classified as high or medium priority. The strategies may be organized by strategy, project constraint, or priority. 
- Communication strategies: This is a description of the methods and mechanisms by which the risk management plan will be communicated throughout the organization. This may reference a project communication plan, if appropriate.

## Audience

The risk management plan is primarily used by information technology (IT) departments and IT security personnel as a means to plan for, mitigate, and accept (risk exception agreement) risks identified as viable against an organization and its IT assets. Project managers also use the risk management plan as a way of documenting the thinking done around risks. It forces the project manager to spend his or her time thinking about risks, and it encourages the project manager to determine the proactive actions that can be taken to better prepare the project for success.

The risk management plan is also used by the project sponsor and key stakeholders. It communicates to them the level of thinking done by the project manager and clarifies his or her understanding of the risks. This fosters trust in the project manager’s ability to bring the project to a successful conclusion. It also helps the sponsor and stakeholders understand their responsibilities on the project to minimize or eliminate risk and the steps that will be taken when a risk event occurs.	risk

Lastly, the project team uses the risk management plan to help it better understand the possible risks and how these risks will be addressed if they occur. Additionally, the risk management plan helps the team understand the project manager’s rationale in certain planning decisions.

## Uses of the Risk Management Plan

The risk management plan is used throughout the project in the following capacities:

- During planning: The project manager references the risk management plan to identify the risks and then incorporate the elimination and reduction actions into project schedules, staffing plans, budgets, vendor arrangements, and so on.
- During project execution: As risks occur during the project, the project manager and the team refer to the plan to execute response plans. Also, the project manager updates the risk list, probabilities/impacts, and plans as the project changes and new risks arise.
- At project closure: The project manager (along with the sponsor and key stakeholders) reviews the risks, probabilities, impacts, and responses at the end of the project to document any lessons learned. The goal is to learn how risk management can be improved on future projects.
- During day-to-day operations: Organizations need to manage risk and ensure servers, workstations, infrastructure equipment, and software used remains operationally viable. To do this, risk must be managed. This includes patching, updating, configuring, developing policies and procedures—essentially everything your IT department and security team needs to minimize risk down to the lowest level possible.
