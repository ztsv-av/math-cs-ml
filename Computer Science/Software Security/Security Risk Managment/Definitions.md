# Risk

The potential for a loss of or damage to an asset. It is based on the value of the asset and the vulnerabilities and threats associated with it. Risk is based on the probability or likelihood of the hazard occurring and the significance of the occurrence.

# Vulnerability

A weakness or flaw in a system’s security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be intentionally exploited or accidentally triggered and could result in a security violations or breaches of the system’s security policy.

# Threat

The potential for an individual or thing to exercise, intentionally exploit, or accidentally trigger a specific vulnerability

# Asset Value

A valuable resource requiring protection. An asset can be tangible (i.e. customers, personnel, buildings, other facilities, equipment, activities, operations, and information) or intangible (e.g., processes or an organization’s reputation).

# Decision Theory

Mathematical and logical concepts, designed to enable managers to formulate rules that may lead to an advantageous course of action under the given conditions. Decision theory divides decisions into three distinct classes:
- Decisions under certainty: Where a manager has far too much information to choose the best alternative
- Decisions under conflict: Where a manager has to anticipate moves and counter-moves of one or more competitors
- Decisions under uncertainty: Where a manager has to dig up a lot of data to make sense of what is going on and what it is leading to

# Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

The system of values and activities present in an organization that shapes risk decisions. Risk culture influences the decisions of management and employees, even if they are not consciously weighing risks and benefits.

# Business impact analysis (BIA)

Predicts the impact of disruption to business functions

# Asset criticality assessment

Identifies and prioritizes the critical and sensitive organization information assets

# Business impact analysis report

Prioritizes the impact levels associated with the compromise of an organization’s information assets based on a quantitative or qualitative assessment

# Confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Also known as the CIA triad, this is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization

# Recovery time objective (RTO)

The maximum tolerable length of time that a computer, system, network, or application can be down after a failure or disaster occurs 

# Prioritization

Determining how resources are allocated to resume business functions

# Critical business functions (CBF) 

CBF are any functions deemed vital to the organization. If the CBF were to fail, the organization would lose the ability to perform critical operations necessary to meet business objectives. IT assets, personnel and services all support CBFs, and you must have a firm grasp on these to be effective at recovery.

# Maximum allowable outage (MAO)

MAO is the maximum amount of time a system, service or critical business function can be down before it affects the business objectives for an organization. “Affect” can mean many different things and is largely dependent upon your organization and what industry, service or product you offer

# Configuration Management Database (CMDB)

CMDB has your assets, personnel and other valuable information in one place. CMDBs allow you to organize and prioritize these assets so that you can be more effective in your contingency planning around CBFs, MAOs and RTOs. Without this organizational tool, it would be difficult to successfully get through a contingency situation.

# The Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) 

DRP covers tactics and procedures to help prevent a disaster with regard to what immediate steps should be taken if a disaster strikes and how to get the company functioning after a disaster. Disaster recovery plans vary greatly depending on their needs, so certain disaster recovery plans may have additional sections while other plans may omit sections depending on their needs. Regardless of the variation, the disaster recovery plan should spell out what needs to be done, how to do it, and where to get the necessary resources.
