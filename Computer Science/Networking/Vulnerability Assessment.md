# Vulnerability Assessment

Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying the weaknesses in a system or network. Attackers take advantage of vulnerabilities in order to gain access to information or networks they aren't authorized to access. An administrator performs vulnerability assessment in order to plug security holes and provide a more secure network.

## Vulnerability Assessment Tools

1. Vulnerability Scanner - a vulnerability scanner is a software program that passively searches an application, computer, or network for weaknesses, such as:
- Open ports
- Active IP addresses
- Running applications or services
- Missing critical patches
- Default user accounts that have not been disabled
- Default or blank passwords
- Misconfigurations
- Missing security controls
  
A vulnerability scanner:
- Should be updated regularly to include the latest known vulnerabilities.
- Is the least intrusive method for checking the environment for known software flaws (port scanners and penetration testers are potentially more intrusive; protocol analyzers cannot check for known software flaws).
- Can be used to scan again after a security hole has been patched in order to verify that the vulnerability has been removed and the system is secure.
  
There are several security tools that can be used for vulnerability scanning.
- Nessus is a comprehensive vulnerability assessment tool.
- Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) is used to evaluate security vulnerabilities in Microsoft products.
- Retina Vulnerability Assessment Scanner is used to remotely scan an organization's network for vulnerabilities.

2. Ping Scanner - a ping scanner is a tool that sends ICMP echo/request packets to one or multiple IP addresses. To protect against attacks that use ICMP, use a ping scanner to identify the systems on the network that respond to ICMP requests, and then configure those systems to block ICMP messages. A vulnerability scanner often includes a ping scanner.

3. Port Scanner - a port scanner is a tool that probes systems for open ports. The most common use of a port scanner is to perform a TCP SYN scan.
- A port scanner performs a two-way handshake (also called a half-open scan), which does not complete the TCP three-way handshake process (the TCP session is not established).
- Devices that respond have ports that are in a listening state.
- The port scan output is a combination of the IP address and port number separated by a colon (for example, 192.168.0.1:x, where x is the port number) for both the source and the destination of the port scan.
  
Nmap is a common port scanner.

4. Network Mapper - a network mapper is a tool that discovers devices on the network and displays the devices in a graphical representation. Network mappers typically use a ping scan to discover devices and a port scanner to identify open ports on those devices.

Many port scanners are technically network mappers.

5. Password Cracker - a password cracker is a tool that performs cryptographic attacks on passwords. Use a password cracker to identify weak passwords and passwords protected with weak encryption. Common password cracking tools include the following:
- John the Ripper
- Cain & Abel
- L0phtcrack (also called LC6)

6. Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) - the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language is an international standard for testing, analyzing, and reporting the security vulnerabilities of a system.
- OVAL is co-sponsored by the office of Cybersecurity and Communications at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
- OVAL regulates the proper XML format for describing and documenting system vulnerabilities.
- Each vulnerability, configuration issue, program, or patch that might be present on a system is called a definition.
- OVAL repositories are like libraries or databases that contain multiple definitions.
