# Network types

## Peer-to-peer Network

Peer-to-peer Network - network, where individual hosts do not have a specific role. They both provide and consume network services (such as printing and storage). In other words, workstations on the network function both as a client and as a server at the same time.  

### Advantages
- very easy to implement;
- inexpensive.  

### Disadvantages
- not scalable (bigger it gets - harder it is to maintain);
- difficult to support;
- lack centralized control;
- decentralized storage (many data storage places in a network).  

## Client-Server Network

Client-Server Network - network, where hosts serve a specific role. These roles are: server - provides network resources and services (ex. printing, storage, web server), and client - consumes network services.

### Advantages
- very scalable (relatively easy to expand network);
- easy to support, due to the role management;
- centralized services;
- data protection (easy backup).

### Disadvantages
- expensive (server hardware and server operating systems);
- requires advanced planning.
