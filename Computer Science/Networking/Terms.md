| Term | Definition |
|----- |----------- |
| Network | Group of interconnected computers and other devices that are able to share information with each other. Network advantages: centralize data storage, share peripheral devices (ex. printers), increase internal and external communications, increase productivity and collaboration. |
| Subnet | A subnet is a portion of a network with a common network address. All devices on the subnet share the same network address, but they have unique host addresses. Each subnet in a larger network has a unique subnet address. Devices connected through hubs or switches are on the same subnet. Routers are used to connect multiple subnets. |
| Internetwork | A network with geographically dispersed WAN connections that connect multiple LANs is often called an internetwork. Additionally, connecting two networks under different management is a form of internetworking because data must travel between two networks. |
| Nodes / Hosts | Computers and devices that have a need to communicate with each other in the network. |
| Connecting Media | Connects network devices with each other. Examples: twisted pair, fiber optic, Wi-Fi radio signals. |
| Network Interface | Converts digital data from the computer into some type of a signal that can be transmitted on the network (connecting) medium or converts signal from the medium into digital data that devices can process. It can use electrical, light or radio signals to send data on the medium. |
| Network Protocols (Standarts) | Defines how transmitted data is going to be formatted. If devices are not using the same network protocol, they are not going to be able to understand the data that is being communicated. |
| Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) | The Internet Protocol (IP) address identifies the network and host address assigned to a device. |
| Subnet Address | The portion of the IP address that identifies the network the device is assigned to. |
| Personal Area Network (PAN) | A personal area network is a very small network used for communicating between personal devices. For example, a PAN may include a notebook computer, a wireless headset, a wireless printer, and a smart phone. A PAN is limited in range to only a few feet. A PAN is typically created using Bluetooth wireless technologies.| 
| Local Area Network (LAN) | A group of computers and associated devices that share a common communications line or wireless link, typically to a server. |
| Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) | A wireless LAN covers an area that is roughly the same size as a standard LAN. However, it uses radio signals instead of wires to connect systems together. |
| Campus Area Network (CAN) | A Campus Area Network (CAN) is a computer network made up of an interconnection of local area networks (LANs) within a limited geographical area, such as a university's campus. Most of the networking components, such as the transmission media, switches, and routers are owned by the campus tenant. |
| Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) | All of the networks within the same metropolitan area that are connected together. |
| Wide Area Network (WAN) | A WAN connects several LANs. Wans are often limited to a corporation or an organization, but are sometimes accessible to the public. |
| Internet | The internet is a collection of many different networks owned by many different entities that all share information and communicate together (interconnection of networks). |
| Intranet | A local or restricted communications network, especially a private network created using World Wide Web software. | 
| Extranet | An intranet that can be partially accessed by authorized outside users, enabling businesses to exchange information over the internet securely. | 
| Topology | Topology is the term used to describe how devices are connected and how messages flow from device to device. The physical topology describes the way the network is wired. The logical topology describes the way messages are sent. |
| Terminator | Terminators absorb signals and prevent them from reflecting repeatedly back and forth on the cable. Terminators are used with bus topology. |
| Network Adapter (NIC) | Network interface card is a computer hardware component that connects a machine to a medium and transmints and receives data over a network. NICs operate at both Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model. They are specific to a network: to connect to a wired Ethernet network, you need to use an Etherent network adapter that uses RJ45 connection; to connect to a WiFi network, you need to use WiFi network adapter. |
| Transceiver | Transceiver is a device that is installed into a network adapter. It accepts digital data (zero's and one's) and converts it into an electrical signal by converting zero's and one's into positive and negative signals. Some transceivers convert digital data into analog sound signals. |
| Modem | Modulator-demodulator (modem) is a transceiver which takes digital data and converts it into analog sound signal that can be transfered to telephone wires. |
| Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) | SFP is another form of network transceiver which is mainly used on switches and routers to modify the media type used by a port. This allows to easily change connecting media on a router. |
| Bi-directional transceiver (BiDi) | BiDi is almost the save device as SFP. The main difference between them is that BiDi can transmit and receive data through a single connecting media at the same time (SFPs use two cables, one to receive and one to send data). |
| Media Converter | Media converters are Layer 1 (Physical layer of the OSI model) devices that convert one type of network connection into another (one type of signal into another). For example, it can convert a twister-pair connection into a fiber optic by using a fiber-optic-to-Ethernet copper cable media converter. |
| Media Access Controll Address (MAC Address) | MAC address is 48-bit number that uniquely identifies network adapter by 12 characters. Each character is hexidecimal, meaning that it ranges from 0-9 and from A-F. The 12 characters are often displayed in six groups of two separated by either dashes or colons,or three groups of four separated by a period. MAC addresses function at Layer 2 of the OSI model. |
| Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) | ARP is a technique that is used to identify the destination MAC address from a known IP address. When a device sends data to another device in a network, it might not know the destination MAC address. It creates a special frame with its own source address and broadcast (all values set to F) MAC address. This broadcast address is placed as the destination address of the ARP frame. Then, the frame is sent to all computers on a network. Each computer receives the ARP frame, opens it and looks at the packet's IP address. If it matches, the computer responds to the packet by sending its MAC address back to the sender computer, which in turn saves the previously unknown MAC address in the ARP table. In case when a device knows a destination MAC address but it does not know the IP address, it uses the techique called 'reverse ARP' (RARP). |
| Hub / Repeater |	A hub simply connects devices using the same media type. All devices are members of the same collision and broadcast domains. Hub is a device that repeats information across all devices in the network. When a machine connected to a hub sends an information, the information is duplicated to every other port on the hub. Hub is the central connecting point of a physical star, where all devices connect to a central point. It operates on the 1st Layer of the OSI model. |
| Bridge |	A device that connects two (or more) media segments together. It filters traffic between both segments based on the MAC address in the frame and can isolate electrical signals between media segments to prevent unnecessary network traffic. It uses a forwarding database (MAC address table) to save MAC addresses of the devices in the network. Bridge is a Layer 2 device. |
| Wireless Bridge | Wireless bridge is a bridge that connects two network segments that use different mediums or architectures. For example, wireless bridge can establish a connection between a wired Ethernet network and a wireless network. It does that by converting frames from one architecture into frames used by other architecture. |
| Switch |	A multi-port bridge that performs filtering based on MAC addresses and provides additional features not found in a bridge. Some switches make routing decisions based on the subnet address, meaning that they operate on the Layer 3 of the OSI model. |
| Wireless Access Point (AP) |	A hub for a wireless network. It connects devices on the network by using radio signals. As with a hub, any message sent to any wireless host connected to the AP can be received by all other wireless hosts. |
| Unicast Frame | Unicast frames start with a preamble - a set of alternating ones and zeros terminated by two ones (11) that mark it as a frame. Then it has the destination MAC address followed by the source MAC address and the message (payload/data). In some networks, the data part set to a fixed size. If the data is smaller than the specified size, the unused space in the frame is filled with padding (zeros and ones). The last part of the frame is Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) field, which is used to check whether the transfered data is corrupted or not. Devices use these frames when they communicate with each other across the network. |
| Broadcast Frame | Broadcast frame is essentially an unicast frame, but its destination MAC address is filled with F's. This is done when the source device does not know the destination MAC address and the ARP technique is used. |
| Router | A router is a device that connects two or more network segments or subnets. Routers work different than switches in that they make forwarding decisions based on the network address. A router builds tables of each connected network and its associated port. Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model. |
| Firewall | A firewall is a router with additional security features. Firewalls can be programmed with security rules to restrict the flow of traffic between networks. It determines what network traffic is allowed to leave or enter the network. Firewalls can be configured to make decisions based on the source and destination addresses within each network packet. Firewalls operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model. |
| Ethernet | Ethernet is based on the concept of connecting multiple nodes with the trunk cable (ether), forming a Local Area Network (LAN). In this architecture, computers connect to the ether through a transceiver – a device that converts digital data from the computer into some type of a signal that can be transmitted on the network medium or it receives that signal and converts it into readable data and feeds it to the computer. With Ethernet, the host transceiver receives the message from to the trunk cable and checks if the signal is for its computer by looking at the destination address. If it is, the transceiver passes the converted signal to the computer, and if it not, it sends the message down the cable. To prevent signals from reflecting repeatedly back and forth on the ether, a terminator is placed at both ends of the cable, which absorbs all the messages when they travel down to it. A single Ethernet cable forms a single LAN. Multiple LANs can be connected via a bridge – a special device that forwards the message to the destination network. |
| Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) | CSMA/CD is the way how devices communicate in the Ethernet architecture so that no signal collision occurs. To send a message, a computer first checks if the network free, i.e. no other information is being transfered on the medium. Then, it sends that message to another node. Collision happens if two computers send data at the same time. In this situation, devices send a jam signal to all other nodes in the network. After that, they perform a back-off, where they each wait a random amount of time and start the process all over again. To prevent collision, use a switch instead of a hub. When a device wants to send a message logical circuts inside of the switch close off so that no collusions occur. Then, the message is being transfered to just the destination device. |
| Duplexing | Duplexing is a point-to-point communication system. There is two types of duplexing: half-duplex and full-duplex. Half-duplex occurs in a hub network where devices can only send OR receive data at the same time. In full-duplex, device can send AND receive information simultaneously. Switch networks use full-duplex mode. Full duplex provides double the bandwidth as half-duplex communications. |
| Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) | CRC is the last part of the unicast frame. The CRC contains a mathematical computation that is performed on the frame data before it is transmitted. If the CRC computed on the destination device matches the CRC in the frame, then the computer knows that the data arrived intact. If the value does not match, than something happend to it during transmission. |
| Protocol Suite | A group of network protocols used together. The most commonly used protocol suite is TCP/IP (Transmision Control Protocol), which is used on the internet and on most networks. |
| TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) or Internet Protocol Suite | TCP/IP is the most commonly used protocol suite. It controls transmissions between computers on a network (including the internet). |
| TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or Connection-oriented Protocol | When message is sent using TCP, the device sending the information does its best to make sure that the computer receiving the information gets the message with no errors. It does this by requiring the receving computer acknowledge each message pack it receives from the sender. It is a secure method of message transfer, meaning that no data will be lost. Email services use TCP. |
| UDP (User datagram protocol) | UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it transmits messages regardless of whether transmission errors occur (destination device does not check each data pack it receives). This method transfers data very quickly because data acknowledging is removed. Audio and video streaming service use UDP. |
| OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model | OSI model is a standardized method of implementing network communications. OSI model divides network communication between two devices - sender and receiver - into layers. These layers divide communication process into general tasks. There are 7 different layers: application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, physical. When a sender sends a message to a receiver, that message goes through the 7 layers of the OSI model, from the application to the physical. Each layer preprocesses that message according to the layers' specification and then forwards it to the next layer. Next, preprocessed information is transmitted to the receiving device. When information arrives at the receiver, the same process is used, but in reverse. |
| Straight-through Cable | Straight-through cable is a media that is used to connect devices. This cable does not perform crossing function, so it is used to connect different workstation together. |
| Crossover Cable | Crossover cable is used to connect two workstations. It crosses so that the transmit pin connects to the receiver pin and vice versa on the NIC. If you use straight-through cable to connecto two NICs, it will connect transmit pin with the transmit pin and receiver pin with the receiver pin, which is wrong. If you use a switch to connect two devices, it will automatically perform the crossing function, so you will need to use straight-through cables in this situation. There is a rule: if you connect two similar devices, use crossover cable, otherwise use straight-through cable. |
| Uplink Port | Uplink port is a port inside of a switch that is used to connect to another switch. This is called cascading. Remember that uplink port perfroms crossover function. |
| Auto-MDI or MDIX | Auto-MDI or MDIX is a feature that allows hubs and switches to sense the table of the cable used and the type of the device on either end. Then, it automatically enables or disables crossing on that port. This makes using correct cable obsolete. |
| Rollover Cable | A rollover cable is a cable with an RJ45 connector on one end and an RS232 (serial) connector on the other end. Use a rollover cable to connect the serial port on a workstation to the console connector on a router or switch, and then run a terminal emulation program on the workstation to connect to the console of the router or switch to perform configuration and management tasks. A rollover cable might also have an RJ45 connector on both ends, requiring an adapter to convert from the RJ45 connector to the serial cable. |
| Spread Specturm Signal Transmission (SSS) | SSS is a technique used to increase bandwidth and reduce interference when transfering information in a wireless network. Using this technique, the radio transmitter on the network spreads the data across a wide band of frequencies. In other words, data is transmitted on multiple frequency channels at the same time by breaking the data up. Then, the data is received and restored back to its original form. For this to work, the transmitter and the received must be in tune. |
| Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) | FHSS uses a narrow frequency band and hops data signals in a predictable sequence from frequency to frequency over a wide band of frequencies. Because FHSS shifts automatically between frequencies, it can avoid interference that may be on a single frequency. Hopping between frequencies increases transmission security by making eavesdropping and data capture more difficult. |
| Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) | With DSSS, the transmitter breaks data into pieces and sends the pieces across multiple frequencies in a defined range. DSSS is more susceptible to interference and less secure then FHSS.| 
| Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) | OFDM breaks data into very small data streams to send the information across long distances where environmental obstacles may be an issue. OFDM: Modulates adjacent radio signals orthogonally, meaning a linear transfer that preserves length and distance. This allows for a very large number of small data streams in a single frequency; Reduces the effects of signal interference caused by environmental obstacles such as walls or buildings; Is used by 802.11g/a/n and ac wireless networks to achieve higher transfer speeds. |
| Ghost Signal | Ghost signal is a reflection of an original signal. It is created when the original signal bounces from enviromental obstacles, such as walls, and still arrives to a receiver device, but slighty later. Reflected signals can disrupt wireless network communications because they are identical to the original signals. |
| Basic Service Set (BSS) | BSS is the smallest networking unit of a wireless network. In other words, it is a collection of all devices that communicate together using the same frequency channel. |
| Backhaul | Backhaul is the link between wired network and wireless access points. For example, blackhaul is established when you connect multiple BSSes with a wired network. |
| Distribution System (DS) | DS is the backbone or LAN that connects multiple APs (and BSSs) together. The DS allows wireless clients to communicate with the wired network and with wireless clients in other cells. |
| Extended Service Set (ESS) | ESS is a collection of multiple basic service sets. ESS is identified by a network name, called the service set identifier (SSID). |
| Malware | Malware is an application or software that infiltrates, damages and even gains control a computer system. Usually it is designed to take advantage of somebodys data and recources. There are many malware types, some of them are: virus (stealth, multipartite, macro, polymorphic, retro, companion, phage), worm, Trojan Horse, rootkit, logic bomb, spyware, adware, ransomware, scareware, crimeware. |
| Denial of Service (DoS) | Denial of service attacks are designed to overload a system and prevent network clients from using system services. The attacker overloads a server with numerous fake requests so that requests from actual users will never get through. There are multiple types of DoS attacks: DoS, DDoS, DrDoS, unintentional DoS, PDoS, protocol and packet abuse. |
| UDP Flooding | UDP Flooding is a type of a DoS attack. It sends a lot of packets for the target machine to process to occupy its recources as it tries to handle that flood of requests. |
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS) | IDS is a network security system that detects, and in some cases responds to, a cybersecurity attack on the network. There are three ways how IDSs are classified. The first way is how it reacts to an attack (passive IDS and active IDS). Second is how it detects an attack, or its attack recognition method (signature recognision and anomaly recognition). Finally, third way is its detection scope - where it runs on a system and what types of threats it detects. |
| Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) | SIEM is a software that helps you manage your network security much more quickly and efficiently. It recognizes, analyzes and fixes any security issues found in the network by aggregating data from all of the devices and applications into a single location. |
| Centralized Logging | Centralized logging is the process where log files from all of your network devices and systems are forwarded to and stored on a central log server. This has a lot of advantages towards log maintanance. For instance, centralized logging allows you an instant access to all of your network log files. |
| Protocol Analyzer | Protocol analyzer is a tool (hardware or software) used to monitor and analyze data traffic transfering over a network. It can be used for logging, sniffing, intercepting, analyzing perfomance, monitoring network and troubleshooting. |
| Load Balancing | Load balancing divides the network load between multiple servers and distributes client connections among the servers. This is done to increase perfromance and fault tolerance of provided services. |
| Caching | Caching is a perfomance technique that reduces internet traffic by storing most frequently used data (e.g. user data) locally for quick access. Instead of making another DNS query and wasting time, your device will pull the same information from the cache. |
| Quality of Service (QoS) | QoS is another perfomance solution that reduces delays in communication over a network for time-sensitive traffic, like VoIP and video. QoS ensures that time-sensitive (high priority) traffic is delivered before other (low priority) traffic by creating traffic queues. |
| Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) | DMZ is a subnetwork that is placed between a LAN and other unsecure networks or internet. External network devices can only accesss what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the LAN is protected by firewalls. Email, web and DNS servers are often placed in the DMZ. |
| Policy (Document) | A policy govern overall configuration of the network, that is goals and requirements. In simple words, it describes what should be done to achieve something, but not always how it should be done. There are policies for administrative delegation, network documentation and security, and two types of policies: Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) and Consent to Monitoring Policies (CTMP). |
| Regulation (Document) | a regulation is a requirement published by a licensing body. Regulations should be understood and adhered to by everybody. |
| Procedure (Document) | A procedure is a document that defines step-by-step plan on how to implement a specific action. It ensures that goals are met. Procedures are controlled by the organization's defined policies. |
| Design Process | Network design is a crucial part of building a properly working network. It should not be ommitted. Design process constists of several main steps: conducting a needs assessment, designing the physical topology, designing the logical topology, planning network services, selecting hardware and software, planning authentication and authorization systems. |
| Needs Assessment | Needs assessment is a step in a design process. It defines the purpose/goals and the scope of the project, expected outcomes and expected completion (what is the result of the project). |
| Network Services (Design) | Planning network services is an another step in network design process. It consists of the following: arranging for access to support network recources, planning for future expansion and data protection, verifying compatibility with operating systems, applications and services, verifying system requirements of the network OS, allocating data center space for server hardware. |
| Network Authentication (Design) | Network authentication is a step in designing a network. It defines where all user accounts will be stored and how authorization will be controlled. Network Authentication step also describes how a network access control list (ACL) will be used. |
| Network Documentation | Network documentation plays a huge role when managing network perfomance, trobuleshooting network problmes and recovering the network after a disaster. Network documentation is created using the following steps: preparing the document, mapping the network, listing network devices, creating network baselines (what normally working devices look like), and creating organiztional documents. |
| Asset | An asset is a hardware or software that has been purchased and used in your network. It includes servers, workstations, phone systems, operating systems, firewalls, routers, switches, and software. |
| WAN Connectivity Issues | When connecting several LANs to establish a wide area network, you might encounter several connectivity issues. Some of these issues include: company security policies that might block WAN communications, WAN service provider that might throttle bandwidth, and infrastructure limitations that migth distrupt or block WAN connection. |
