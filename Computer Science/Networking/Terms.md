| Term                                   | Definition                                                                                                   |

| Network                                | Group of interconnected computers and other devices that are able to share information with each other. Network advantages: centralize data storage, share peripheral devices (ex. printers), increase internal and external communications, increase productivity and collaboration.      |
| Subnet | A subnet is a portion of a network with a common network address. All devices on the subnet share the same network address, but they have unique host addresses. Each subnet in a larger network has a unique subnet address. Devices connected through hubs or switches are on the same subnet. Routers are used to connect multiple subnets. |
| Internetwork | A network with geographically dispersed WAN connections that connect multiple LANs is often called an internetwork. Additionally, connecting two networks under different management is a form of internetworking because data must travel between two networks. |
| Nodes / Hosts                          | Computers and devices that have a need to communicate with each other in the network.                        |
| Connecting Media                       | Connects network devices with each other. Examples: twisted pair, fiber optic, Wi-Fi radio signals.          |
| Network Interface                      | Converts digital data from the computer into some type of a signal that can be transmitted on the network (connecting) medium or converts signal from the medium into digital data that devices can process. It can use electrical, light or radio signals to send data on the medium.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Network Protocols (Standarts)          | Defines how transmitted data is going to be formatted. If devices are not using the same network protocol, they are not going to be able to understand the data that is being communicated.                                                                                                         |
| Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) | The Internet Protocol (IP) address identifies the network and host address assigned to a device.             |
| Subnet Address                         | The portion of the IP address that identifies the network the device is assigned to.                         |
| Personal Area Network (PAN) | A personal area network is a very small network used for communicating between personal devices. For example, a PAN may include a notebook computer, a wireless headset, a wireless printer, and a smart phone. A PAN is limited in range to only a few feet. A PAN is typically created using Bluetooth wireless technologies.| 
| Local Area Network (LAN)               | A group of computers and associated devices that share a common communications line or wireless link, typically to a server.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) | A wireless LAN covers an area that is roughly the same size as a standard LAN. However, it uses radio signals instead of wires to connect systems together. |
| Campus Area Network (CAN) | A Campus Area Network (CAN) is a computer network made up of an interconnection of local area networks (LANs) within a limited geographical area, such as a university's campus. Most of the networking components, such as the transmission media, switches, and routers are owned by the campus tenant. |
| Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)        | All of the networks within the same metropolitan area that are connected together.                           |
| Wide Area Network (WAN)                  | A WAN connects several LANs. Wans are often limited to a corporation or an organization, but are sometimes accessible to the public.                                                                                                                                                 |
|Internet                                | The internet is a collection of many different networks owned by many different entities that all share information and communicate together (interconnection of networks).                                                                                                                                               |
|Intranet                                | A local or restricted communications network, especially a private network created using World Wide Web software.                                                                                                                                               |       
|Extranet                                | An intranet that can be partially accessed by authorized outside users, enabling businesses to exchange information over the internet securely.                                                                                                                                               |       
| Topology | Topology is the term used to describe how devices are connected and how messages flow from device to device. The physical topology describes the way the network is wired. The logical topology describes the way messages are sent. |
| Terminator | Terminators absorb signals and prevent them from reflecting repeatedly back and forth on the cable. Terminators are used with bus topology. |
