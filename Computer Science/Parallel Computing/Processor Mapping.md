# Processor Mapping

Processor mapping is the logical organization and management of the computing elements to bring the more transparent output of the data. It ensures that the information recorded from the source is correctly translated to the destination. With this understanding, it is, therefore, worthwhile to discuss various techniques that can be used for reducing the execution time. The central idea behind mapping is to minimize the lagging of information as it is exchanged between the nodes.
