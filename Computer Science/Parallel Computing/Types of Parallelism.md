# Types of Parallelism

- Implicit Parallelism: Implicit parallelism is an attribute of programming languages that enables the compiler to immediately utilize the parallelism innate to the computations embedded within the language's constructs. Parallelism refers to the type of computation that performs many processes and calculations simultaneously rather than sequentially. Thus, implicit parallelism occurs when a computer program automatically understands to process calculations simultaneously because of an aspect of the language.
