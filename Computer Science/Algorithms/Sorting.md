# Sorting

Sorting consists of arranging an unordered list of numbers into an increasing or decreasing list of numbers.

There are a couple of categories of sorting algorithms: internal or external.  In the internal sorting, the number of elements in the list to be sorted is small enough where it can fit the memory. The external sorting would require external storage to sort the data since the data list is too small to fit the available memory. Sorting algorithms can also be categories as comparison-based or non-comparison-based algorithms.

The first (comparison-based) would sort an unordered sequence of elements by repeatedly comparing pairs of values. If these values are out of order, they are exchanged. This operation is also known as compare-exchange sorting. The non-comparison based algorithms sort by using certain known properties of the elements.
