# Seven Domains of IT Infrasctructure

## User Domain

In the user domain, the key threats are as follows:

Lack of user awareness to information security practices
User indifference toward policies
User intentionally violating security policies
User trying to circumvent security policies
User utilizing portable media with personal files
User downloading photos, music, or videos
User destroying systems, applications, and data
Discontented employee attacking organization or committing sabotage
Employee extortion or blackmail

## Workstation Domain

In the workstation domain, the key threats are as follows:

Unsanctioned workstation access
Unsanctioned access to applications, data, and systems
Vulnerabilities in desktop and laptop operating systems
Desktop or laptop application software vulnerabilities not patched
Desktop or laptop application software not upgraded
Viruses, malicious code, and other malware
User utilizing portable media with personal files
User downloading photos, music, or videos

## LAN Domain

In the LAN domain, the key threats are as follows:

Unsanctioned physical access to LAN
Unsanctioned access to systems
Inappropriate access to data and applications
Operating system vulnerabilities in LAN Server
LAN server applications not patched for vulnerabilities and not updated
Rogue users on WLANs
Confidentiality of data on WLANs
LAN server configuration guidelines and standards

## LAN-to-WAN Domain

In the LAN-to-WAN, domain the key threats are as follows:

Unsanctioned probing and port scanning
Unsanctioned access
Vulnerabilities in network appliances, router, and firewall
Users downloading unauthorized files from unknown and questionable sources

## WAN Domain

In the WAN domain, the key threats are as follows:

Open network that public has access to data
Most network traffic sent unencrypted as clear text
Susceptible to eavesdropping
Susceptible to malicious attacks
Susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
Susceptible to information and data corruption
Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) applications insecure
Hackers and attackers attempt attacks with Trojans, worms, and other types of malicious software via e-mail constantly

## Remote Access Domain

In the remote access domain, the key threats are as follows:

Password and brute force attacks
Attacks against access controls and multiple login attempts
Remote unsanctioned access to Information Technology systems, applications, and data
Confidential data compromised remotely
Violation of data classification standards resulting in data leakage

## System/Application Domain

In the system/application domain, the key threats are as follows:

Unsanctioned access to data centers, computer rooms, and network closets
Difficult-to-manage servers that require high availability
Vulnerability management of server operating systems
Virtual cloud computing environments that require security
Lost data or data corruption

By analyzing the key threats that are presented in these domains and then applying the principles of risk mitigation, an organization can identify what the need to do to obtain a good security risk management posture.
