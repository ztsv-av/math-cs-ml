# Business Continuity Plan

A business continuity plan (BCP) is a plan to help ensure that business processes can continue during a time of emergency or disaster. Such emergencies or disasters might include a fire or any other case where business is not able to occur under normal conditions. Businesses need to look at all such potential threats and devise BCPs to ensure continued operations should the threat become a reality. The BCP should be strategic in nature, and knowledge of your IT assets is critical in executing the BCP. Without knowledge of your critical technology assets, you won’t know what your organization needs to continue operations.

A business continuity plan involves the following:

- Analysis of organizational threats
- A list of the primary tasks required to keep the organization operations flowing (to include your technology assets)
- Easily located management contact information and a process for executing notifications and recall efforts
- Explanation of where personnel should go if there is a disastrous event. This could include the following:
 - Cold sites: Buildings with power              
 - Warm sites: Facilities with power and some equipment needed
 - Hot sites: Facilities that have a complete back up of your organizational operating environment
- Information on data backups and organization site backup
- Collaboration among all facets of the organization
- Buy-in from everyone in the organization
  
When developing a BCP, all threats that could cease regular business should be determined. However, be aware that a complete listing is impossible. The next step is to determine the most significant tasks required to continue operations.

## Categorizing all technology assets on a scale

- Mission essential: Technology assets labeled in this category would have a critical impact to your organization’s ability to execute its business objectives. For instance, if you sell products online, your Web servers and database servers would be classified as mission essential. Without them, you can’t have a Web site to sell your products or databases to track inventory when sales occur.
- Essential: Technology assets labeled in this category would have a significant impact to your organization’s ability to execute its business objectives. For instance, going without e-mail servers for a specific period of time could have significant impact to business objectives. You’ll be able to get by for a time using phones and other means of communication (fax, digital senders, etc.), but e-mail is really crucial to an organization.
- Non-essential: Technology assets labeled in this category would have no impact to your organization’s business objectives. Examples include desktop systems and office applications. Your organization can continue to work without them for extended periods of time.

The categories listed above are just suggestions.

## Personnel

Now that you have a good idea of what you have and what you need, you can move on to personnel. What are your personnel requirements? What skills, talents, and numbers are needed to maintain business operations? Do you need skill sets one, two, three, or more levels deep? What skills are needed, coding and developing, network administration, system administration, project management, or sales? Knowing what skills are needed and the number of personnel you have is like having a well-stocked tool box with all the pertinent tools to do the job at hand.
Emphasis on processes and procedures is an important aspect when considering personnel skill sets. What happens if they’re unavailable? Having well-documented processes and procedures can often assist you in maintaining operations.

## Data
Understand your data requirements. What are your organizational needs around data? What are your current backup schedules? Do you have onsite backup, offsite backup, or a combination of the two? How many days, weeks, or months would be needed to set up secondary operations in a disaster situation? You need to also have a good grasp on how easily accessible these data are and what the process is for retrieving them.

## Tests

Finally you’ll need to conduct exercises and run table top scenarios to adequately prepare for an event. The last thing you want to do is have an emergency that could impact business objectives and be thrust into it cold with no preparation. Conduct regular exercises that test your business continuity planning, and use them as opportunities to improve. Often business processes change over time, systems get replaced, and it is important to revisit your BCP often to ensure it stays up to date and relevant.
