# Risk Mitigation

Four ways to address risk are as follows:

- Risk acceptance: The acceptance of a risk where the organization typically does no remediation effort or delays any remediation to a later time.
- Risk avoidance: A process that tries to eliminate risk by a reduction in things such as hazards and negative activities that might affect the organization
- Risk limitation: This strategy limits an organizationâ€™s exposure by performing a limited amount of action. This strategy is employs some risk acceptance and a bit of risk avoidance or an average of both
- Risk transference: When risk is transferred from one party to another. Examples of this include purchasing insurance, a solution that protects a person from harm by allowing someone else to assume the risk
