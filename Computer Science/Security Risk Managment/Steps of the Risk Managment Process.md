# Steps of the Risk Managment Process

## Identification of Risks

The first step in the risk management process is to identify the potential risks involved in projects. The process used can include brainstorming sessions with staff members familiar with previous similar projects within the company or outside of the company. Other stakeholders, such as customers, management from other departments, or other project teams, could be brought into the discussion. The goal is to identify what could happen that might have an adverse effect on the organizational IT assets and pair these risks with potential threat sources.

Improvement in the risk identification process for many organizations involves developing a more structured approach. Careful examination of past incidents will reveal issues that present risks to the organization. Risk identification should also be documented so that future project teams can learn from the problems encountered within the enterprise network.

## Probability of Risks

After potential risks are identified, the probability that they will actually occur must be determined. Too often, the calculation of probabilities of risk is based on general opinions and guesswork. A major improvement in this part of the risk management process is to gather some specific information about the types of risks. Although the information is not always easy to obtain, some effort in this area will pay large dividends if a risk presents a significant cost to the business. Many organizations find it beneficial to create a risk/threat matrix that examines the likelihood and probability that a risk/threat pairing will occur.

In the matrix above, you would determine your risks, determine your threats, and establish the probability and likelihood they might occur. As logic would dictate, you would then address the high-risk/high-threat pairs first and work your way back from there.

## Impact of Risks

One of the most important steps of a risk management process is to determine how bad a risk might be if it actually does occur. Failure to properly determine risk impact can result in ignoring a high-impact risk or in minimizing the danger. The measure of risk impact is subjective, so proper processes are necessary to remove bias and attempt to make the analysis of impact more accurate. Processes for this phase of risk management should include methods of data collection and determinations of accuracy, with reviews conducted by the appropriate people within the organization.

## Mitigation Strategies

Mitigation of risk is the attempt to reduce the probability of a risk item occurring. The risk management process plays an important role in forming mitigation strategies to avoid subjective treatment of potential risk-reducing strategies. For example, mitigation strategies should include processes to validate proposed strategies. All mitigation strategies should be required to include certain measures of risk probability reduction.

## Contingency Plans

Contingency plans are similar to mitigation strategies, but they focus on the impact of risk rather than the probability. The processes used to develop contingency plans can often be improved by enforcing reviews and approvals similar to the process used to develop mitigation strategies.

## Risk Exposure

Ultimately, risk analysis seeks to reduce risk exposure to a company. Exposure is the amount of risk the company faces after risk-reduction strategies are applied to the original risk. Risk exposure is considered to be the risk that cannot be avoided and is also commonly called the threat.

Risk analysis processes often do not address a plan to follow after risk exposure has been identified. Companies often cross their fingers and hope the risk does not actually manifest. Part of a good risk management process should include strategies and plans for how to deal with risk exposure.

One of the choices possible with a risk is to simply avoid it by changing the project plan. For example, if the risk of cost overruns is too high for a company, the project could be cancelled. A good process will quantify the threshold used to make this type of decision.

Another choice possible with a risk is to move forward and assume the risk. Risk management processes should clearly identify how to monitor the potential risk and how to take action if the risk appears to be taking place.
