# Structured Query Language(SQL) as we all know is the database language by
#   the use of which we can perform certain operations on the existing database 
#   and also we can use this language to create a database. SQL uses certain commands 
#   like Create, Drop, Insert, etc. to carry out the required tasks. 

# Entity - table
# Attribute - column
# Record - row
# Relationship - association between entities
# Primary key:
#   unique identifier for a table
#   cannot be NULL
#   a table can have only one primary key
#   all columns in table are functionally dependent on A
# Foreign key:
#   primary key in another table
# Bridge / Linking table:
#   table that connects other tables
#   used to create one-many relationships instead of many-to-many
# one-to-many relationship:
#   one 'student' is related to many 'classes'
#   implement by having a common column in two or more tables
#   e.x.: 'STUDENT_ID' is a column in 'CLASSES' table and 'STUDENT_DATA' table

# Operators
# A traditional set of operators exists for the SQL, as follows:
#   != (not equal to)
#   = (equal to)
#   < (less than)
#   > (greater than)
#   <= (less than or equal to)
#   >= (greater than or equal to)

# Operators can work on both text and numerical data. 
# Similarly, a standard set of mathematical functions exist for the SQL, 
# but the following functions only work against numerical data elements:
#   + (add)
#   – (subtract)
#   / (divide)
#   * (multiply)

# Logical Comparison Operators
# A traditional set of logical comparison operators exists for the SQL, as follows:
#   AND
#   OR
#   NOT

# These SQL commands are mainly categorized into four (five) categories as: 
#   DDL – Data Definition Language
#   DQl – Data Query Language
#   DML – Data Manipulation Language
#   DCL – Data Control Language
#   *TCL - Transaction Control Language

# 1. DDL(Data Definition Language) : DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists 
#   of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply 
#   deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify 
#   the structure of database objects in the database.

# Examples of DDL commands: 
#   CREATE – is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure and triggers).
#   DROP – is used to delete objects from the database.
#   ALTER-is used to alter the structure of the database.
#   TRUNCATE–is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
#   COMMENT –is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
#   RENAME –is used to rename an object existing in the database.

# 2. DQL (Data Query Language) :

# DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. 
# The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. 

# Example of DQL: 
#   SELECT – is used to retrieve data from the database.
#   INSERT
#   UPDATE
#   DELETE

# 3. DML(Data Manipulation Language): The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation 
# of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this 
# includes most of the SQL statements. 

# Examples of DML: 
#   INSERT – is used to insert data into a table.
#    UPDATE – is used to update existing data within a table.
#    DELETE – is used to delete records from a database table.

# 4. DCL(Data Control Language): DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE 
# which mainly deal with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database system. 

# Examples of DCL commands: 
#   GRANT-gives users access privileges to the database.
#   REVOKE-withdraw user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

# 5. TCL(transaction Control Language): TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database. 

# Examples of TCL commands: 
#   COMMIT– commits a Transaction.
#   ROLLBACK– rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
#   SAVEPOINT–sets a savepoint within a transaction.
#   SET TRANSACTION–specify characteristics for the transaction.

# NORMALIZATION
# Normal forms are further described as follows:
#   1NF: This basically states that you must eliminate any duplicate columns within the same table. 
#       Another aspect of this standard is that separate tables should be created for each group of related data, 
#       and each record should have a unique column for the primary key.
#   2NF: This must meet the requirements of 1NF. In this process, you must also develop relationships between 
#       the tables normalized in 1NF and implement the use of foreign keys.
#   3NF: This must meet the requirements of 2NF. The new addition in this standard is to eliminate columns 
#       that are not dependent on the table’s primary key.
#   4NF: This must meet the requirements of 3NF. The only update to this standard that is different from 
#       the first three standards is that the table cannot contain more than one multivalued dependency.
#   5NF: This must meet the requirements of 4NF. It deals with a theory called join dependency.

# Conditional Queries
# Conditional queries are a form of a subquery, 
# but they are used in a different manner. 
# Conditional queries are used either in the WHERE clause or within the actual SELECT clause, 
# providing different information depending on the value of a column.

# Correlated Subquery
# If a subquery contains a reference to a table (or tables) named in the main query, 
# it is called a correlated subquery. 
# Correlated subqueries are used to evaluate columns in a main query directly against those in a subquery. 
# Correlation may be used in most subqueries and is necessary when evaluating columns in a main query against those in an EXISTS subquery, 
# although it is not a requirement in general.
