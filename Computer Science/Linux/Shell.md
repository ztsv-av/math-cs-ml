# Linux Shell

The shell is a command line interpreter, which means that it is a program and has its own programming language.

All of the shells in the C Shell family (csh, tcsh, and so on) are more structured and follow the same basic formatting as the C programming language. All the shells in the Bourne family (sh, ksh, bash, and so on) are pretty much free-form and do not require any particular structure.

| Name | Abbreviation | Info |
| ---- | ------------ | ---- |
|Bourne Shell | sh | This is the oldest of the shells and was designed by Steve Bourne. It is considered to be a bit primitive but is very good for scripting. |
| C Shell |	csh | This is probably the most popular shell. However, even though it adds many nice features that are unavailable in the Bourne shell (e.g., history and job control), it is quite buggy for heavy users. |
| KornShell | ksh | David Korn wrote this shell to be compatible with the Bourne shell but included the cool features introduced by the C Shell. However, it went one step further beyond the C Shell and introduced history editing. |
| Bourne Again Shell | bash | This is similar to the KornShell but with some additional features, such as a built-in help command. |
| TC Shell | tsch |	This is an extended version of the C Shell with the features introduced by ksh and bash. |
