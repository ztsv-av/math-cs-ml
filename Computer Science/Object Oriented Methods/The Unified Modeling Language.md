# The Unified Modeling Language

UML is a common language for modeling object-oriented systems. It represents objects in a system and their relationships. It has two types of notation:

1. Static notation - displays classes and their attributes.
2. Dynamic notation - displays objects and messages.

Until 1995, object concepts were popular but implemented in many different ways by different developers. Each developer had his or her own methodology and notation (e.g., Booch, Coad, Moses, OMT, OOSE, and SOMA).28 Then in 1995, Rational Software brought three industry leaders together to create a single approach to object‐oriented systems development. Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh worked with others to create a standard set of diagramming techniques known as the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The objective of UML was to provide a common vocabulary of object‐oriented terms and diagramming techniques rich enough to model any systems development project from analysis through implementation. In November 1997, the Object Management Group (OMG) formally accepted UML as the standard for all object developers. During the following years, the UML has gone through multiple minor revisions. The current version of UML is Version 2.5.

Version 2.5 of the UML defines a set of fifteen diagramming techniques used to model a system. The diagrams are broken into two major groupings: one for modeling the structure of a system and one for modeling behavior. Structure diagrams provide a way to represent the data and static relationships in an information system. The structure diagrams include class, object, package, deployment, component, composite structure, and profile diagrams. Behavior diagrams provide the analyst with a way to depict the dynamic relationships among the instances or objects that represent the business information system. They also allow modeling of the dynamic behavior of individual objects throughout their lifetime. The behavior diagrams support the analyst in modeling the functional requirements of an evolving information system. The behavior modeling diagrams include activity, sequence, communication, interaction overview, timing, behavior state machine, protocol state machine, and use‐case diagrams.29 Figure 1‐6 provides an overview of these diagrams.

Depending on where in the development process the system is, different diagrams play a more important role. In some cases, the same diagramming technique is used throughout the development process. In that case, the diagrams start off very conceptual and abstract. As the system is developed, the diagrams evolve to include details that ultimately lead to generating and developing code. In other words, the diagrams move from documenting the requirements to laying out the design. Overall, the consistent notation, integration among the diagramming techniques, and application of the diagrams across the entire development process make the UML a powerful and flexible language for analysts and developers.
