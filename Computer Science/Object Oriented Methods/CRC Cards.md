# CRC Cards

CRC (Class–Responsibility–Collaboration) cards are used to document the responsibilities and collaborations of a class. In some object‐oriented and agile systems development methodologies, CRC cards are seen to be an alternative competitor to the Unified Process employment of use cases and class diagrams. However, we see them as a useful, low‐tech approach that can complement a typical high‐tech Unified Process approach that uses CASE tools. We use an extended form of the CRC card to capture all relevant information associated with a class.8 We describe the elements of our CRC cards later, after we explain responsibilities and collaborations.

### Responsibilities and Collaborations

Responsibilities of a class can be broken into two separate types: knowing and doing. Knowing responsibilities are those things that an instance of a class must be capable of knowing. An instance of a class typically knows the values of its attributes and its relationships. Doing responsibilities are those things that an instance of a class must be capable of doing. In this case, an instance of a class can execute its operations or it can request a second instance, which it knows about, to execute one of its operations on behalf of the first instance.

The structural model describes the objects necessary to support the business processes modeled by the use cases. Most use cases involve a set of several classes, not just one class. These classes form collaborations. Collaborations allow the analyst to think in terms of clients, servers, and contracts.9 A client object is an instance of a class that sends a request to an instance of another class for an operation to be executed. A server object is the instance that receives the request from the client object. A contract formalizes the interactions between the client and server objects. Chapter 8 provides a more‐detailed explanation of contracts and examples of their use.

An analyst can use the idea of class responsibilities and client–server–contract collaborations to help identify the classes, along with the attributes, operations, and relationships, involved with a use case. One of the easiest ways to use CRC cards in developing a structural model is through anthropomorphism—pretending that the classes have human characteristics. Members of the development team can either ask questions of themselves or be asked questions by other members of the team. Typically the questions asked are of the form:

Who or what are you?

What do you know?

What can you do?

The answers to the questions are then used to add detail to the evolving CRC cards. For example, in the appointment problem, a member of the team can pretend that he or she is an appointment. In this case, the appointment would answer that he or she knows about the doctor and patient who participate in the appointment and they would know the date and time of the appointment. Furthermore, an appointment would have to know how to create itself, delete itself, and to possibly change different aspects of itself. In some cases, this approach will uncover additional objects that have to be added to the evolving structural model.

## Elements of a CRC Card

The set of CRC cards contains all the information necessary to build a logical structural model of the problem under investigation. Figure 5‐6 shows a sample CRC card. Each CRC card captures and describes the essential elements of a class. The front of the card contains the class name, ID, type, description, associated use cases, responsibilities, and collaborators. The name of a class should be a noun (but not a proper noun, such as the name of a specific person or thing). Just like the use cases, in later stages of development, it is important to be able to trace back design decisions to specific requirements. In conjunction with the list of associated use cases, the ID number for each class can be used to accomplish this. Also, by associating the use cases with the individual classes allows the analyst to be able to track back to determine who the primary actor and stakeholders are. This provides the information required to limit the access to the instances of the class to the individuals who play the roles identified by the primary actors and stakeholders.10 The description is simply a brief statement that can be used as a textual definition for the class. The responsibilities of the class tend to be the operations that the class must contain (i.e., the doing responsibilities).

The back of a CRC card contains the attributes and relationships of the class. The attributes of the class represent the knowing responsibilities that each instance of the class has to meet. Typically, the data type of each attribute is listed with the name of the attribute (e.g., the amount attribute is double and the insurance carrier is text). Three types of relationships typically are captured at this point: generalization, aggregation, and other associations. In Figure 5‐6, we see that a Patient is a‐kind‐of Person and that a Patient is associated with Appointments.

CRC cards are used to document the essential properties of a class. However, once the cards are filled out, the analyst can use the cards and anthropomorphisms in role‐playing (described in the next section) to uncover missing properties by executing the different scenarios associated with the use cases (see Chapter 4). Role‐playing also can be used as a basis to test the clarity and completeness of the evolving representation of the system.

## Role‐Playing CRC Cards with Use Cases

In addition to the object identification approaches described earlier (textual analysis, brainstorming, and patterns), CRC cards can be used in a role‐playing exercise that has been shown to be useful in discovering additional objects, attributes, relationships, and operations. Furthermore, in addition to walkthroughs, described later in this chapter, role‐playing is very useful in testing the fidelity of the evolving structural model. In general, members of the team perform roles associated with the actors and objects previously identified with the different use cases. Technically speaking, the members of the team perform the different steps associated with a specific scenario of a use case. Remember, a scenario is a single, unique execution path through a use case. A useful place to look for the different scenarios of a use case is the activity diagrams (e.g., see Figures 4‐8–4‐12). A different scenario exists for each time a decision node causes a split in the execution path of the use case. Also, scenarios can be identified from the alternative/exceptional flows in a use‐case description. Considering the incremental and iterative nature and that activity diagrams and use‐case descriptions should contain the same information, reviewing both representations will ensure that relevant scenarios are not missed.

1. Review Use Cases
The first step is to review the use‐case descriptions (see Figure 5‐2). This allows the team to pick a specific use case to role‐play. Even though it is tempting to try to complete as many use cases as possible in a short time, the team should not choose the easiest use cases first. Instead, at this point in the development of the system, the team should choose the use case that is the most important, the most complex, or the least understood.
2. Identify Relevant Actors and Objects
The second step is to identify the relevant roles that are to be played. Each role is associated with either an actor or an object. To choose the relevant objects, the team reviews each of the CRC cards and picks the ones that are associated with the chosen use case. For example, in Figure 5‐6, we see that the CRC card that represents the Old Patient class is associated with Use Case number 2. So if we were going to role‐play the Make Old Patient Appt use case (see Figure 5‐2), we would need to include the Old Patient CRC card. By reviewing the use‐case description, we can easily identify the Old Patient and Doctor actors (see Primary Actor and Stakeholders section of the use case description in Figure 5‐2). By reading the event section of the use‐case description, we identify the internal actor role of Receptionist. After identifying all of the relevant roles, we assign each one to a different member of the team.
3. Role‐Play Scenarios
The third step is to role‐play scenarios of the use case by having the team members perform each one. To do this, each team member must pretend that he or she is an instance of the role assigned to him or her. For example, if a team member was assigned the role of the Receptionist, then he or she would have to be able to perform the different steps in the scenario associated with the Receptionist. In the case of the change appointment scenario, this would include steps 2, 5, 6, S‐3, S‐1, and S‐2. However, when this scenario is performed (role‐played), it would be discovered that steps 1, 3, and 4 were incomplete. For example, in Step 1, what actually occurs? Does the Patient make a phone call? If so, who answers the phone? In other words, a lot of information contained in the use‐case description is only identified in an implicit, not explicit, manner. When the information is not identified explicitly, there is a lot of room for interpretation, which requires the team members to make assumptions. It is much better to remove the need to make an assumption by making each step explicit. In this case, Step 1 of the Normal Flow of Events should be modified. Once the step has been fixed, the scenario is tried again. This process is repeated until the scenario can be executed to a successful conclusion. Once the scenario has been successfully concluded, the next scenario is performed. This is repeated until all of the scenarios of the use case can be performed successfully.13
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3
The fourth step is to simply repeat steps 1 through 3 for the remaining use cases.
