# UML Diagrams

- Behavior diagrams. A type of diagram that depicts behavioral features of a system or business process. This includes activity, state machine, and use case diagrams as well as the four interaction diagrams.
- Interaction diagrams. A subset of behavior diagrams which emphasize object interactions. This includes communication, interaction overview, sequence, and timing diagrams.
- Structure diagrams. A type of diagram that depicts the elements of a specification that are irrespective of time. This includes class, composite structure, component, deployment, object, and package diagrams.

| Diagram| Description| Learning Priority |
| -| - | - |
| Activity Diagram| Depicts high-level business processes, including data flow, or to model the logic of complex logic within a system. See UML Activity diagram guidelines.| High |
| Class Diagram| Shows a collection of static model elements such as classes and types, their contents, and their relationships. See UML Class diagram guidelines.| High |
| Communication Diagram| Shows instances of classes, their interrelationships, and the message flow between them. Communication diagrams typically focus on the structural organization of objects that send and receive messages. Formerly called a Collaboration Diagram. See UML Collaboration diagram guidelines.| Low |
| Component Diagram| Depicts the components that compose an application, system, or enterprise. The components, their interrelationships, interactions, and their public interfaces are depicted. See UML Component diagram guidelines.| Medium |
| Composite Structure Diagram| Depicts the internal structure of a classifier (such as a class, component, or use case), including the interaction points of the classifier to other parts of the system.| Low |
| Deployment Diagram| Shows the execution architecture of systems. This includes nodes, either hardware or software execution environments, as well as the middleware connecting them. See UML Deployment diagram guidelines.| Medium |
| Interaction Overview Diagram| A variant of an activity diagram which overviews the control flow within a system or business process. Each node/activity within the diagram can represent another interaction diagram.| Low |
| Object Diagram| Depicts objects and their relationships at a point in time, typically a special case of either a class diagram or a communication diagram.| Low |
| Package Diagram| Shows how model elements are organized into packages as well as the dependencies between packages. See Package diagram guidelines.| Low |
| Sequence Diagram| Models the sequential logic, in effect the time ordering of messages between classifiers. See UML Sequence diagram guidelines.| High |
| State Machine Diagram | Describes the states an object or interaction may be in, as well as the transitions between states. Formerly referred to as a state diagram, state chart diagram, or a state-transition diagram. See UML State chart diagram guidelines. | Medium |
| Timing Diagram | Depicts the change in state or condition of a classifier instance or role over time. Typically used to show the change in state of an object over time in response to external events. | Low |
| Use Case Diagram | Shows use cases, actors, and their interrelationships. See UML Use case diagram guidelines. | Medium |
