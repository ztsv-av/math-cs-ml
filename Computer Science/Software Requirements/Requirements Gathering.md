# Requirements Gathering

## Joint Application Development

Joint application development or joint application design (JAD) would bring the users, analysts, and management together to define the requirements from both a business and IT systems perspective. The idea is to have the people, who know the business and technology the best, get together with the management, who can give them support and direction, all in one room, working as partners, sharing their insights, and agreeing on the requirements.

JAD sessions are usually held across several days in the form of intense workshops that require all participants to devote hours to discuss the requirements without any distraction about their daily responsibilities. Similar to all other approaches to gather requirements, it is critical to have the right group of people in the JAD session, building a diverse team that is inclusive of all areas of business affected.

The following are roles that must have representatives in the session:

- Business: Role taken by users, project sponsors, and management when providing input, as well as supporting and making decisions
  
- Facilitator: Role taken by project managers or lead analysts when facilitating the sessions. The facilitator must plan the JAD session, invite the appropriate stakeholders and management representatives, and set the agenda. The facilitator’s job is to keep the session structured and lead the workshop toward an agreement on the requirements and design. The session must be an environment where the business needs, the technical constraints, and the possibilities are discussed openly with the goal of driving the session toward a possible design solution.
  
- Technical team: Role taken by systems analysts, developers, or other technical experts when making sure that the system aligns with the business needs
  
- Scribe: Role taken by a member of the project team when documenting the JAD session to be used for systems development

### JAD Phases

The JAD planning session should start with the facilitator explaining the purpose and the items in the agenda. The next step is to explain the rules to follow and the procedure for the session. A brief introduction of participant roles and expectations would help lead the discussion toward identifying the business processes and entities that will be impacted.

The JAD design phase should start with a discussion about the high-level data and processes and then go to a more detailed level to define user or system interfaces. When conducting a JAD session, the facilitator should discuss the following topics to first document the high-level information and then move to discussing them in detail once the participants reach an agreement:

- As-is process
- Data flow
- User interfaces (input/output)
- System interfaces
- Any additional technical specifications such as performance or security

Drawing diagrams and using visual tools would help engage JAD participants and encourage creativity.

1. Identify the JAD participants.
2. Organize the JAD session.
3. Lead the active discussion.
4. Provide technical advice.
5. Document the as-is and to-be process details that have been agreed upon.
6. Create a prototype.
7. Present the prototype and not feedback from the business.
8. Go back to Step 1 for the next iteration.

## Rapid Application Development

Rapid application development (RAD) is another version of JAD that is commonly used for Web application development. As the name implies, it is more fast paced than JAD and has possibly lower cost. It produces a functioning system as a prototype, and it repeats the process until it produces a system that meets all customers’ expectations. However, this approach focuses more on the user's experience and less on the business strategic needs. Another disadvantage when compared to JAD is the possibility of skipping standards to save time. Therefore, there is less time to spend on the quality and consistency of the design.
