## Stakeholders, Customers, Users

A stakeholder is anyone with an interest (or a stake) in a project. For every project, you need to identify your key stakeholders. When you do that, you initially want to consider almost every possible potential stakeholder and then try to focus down on those that will really be relevant to your system. The following can all be stakeholders:
- A person or a group that is actively involved in the project
- A person or a group that will be affected by the project

Sometimes people use the terms stakeholders, customers, and end users to refer to the same thing. These people should be distinguishable from each other. The following information provides definitions of each group:

- Customers: This is a subset of stakeholders. Customers are a person or a group that will derive direct or indirect benefit from that system. Some stakeholders may not be customers, such as the legal staff that will draft any legal contract. They are involved with the project, but they will not benefit or use that system.

- Users: This is a subset of customers. A user is a person or a group that will actually use the system. Direct users are hands-on users that will interact directly with the system. Indirect users will see or deal with the output of the system, such as a manager who will receive a daily sales report from the system.

## Common System Stakeholders

A system has many different people (stakeholders) who have an interest in the system and its successful outcomes. The following list briefly describes common project stakeholders:

- Executive team: They are interested in a project's impact on a business, both in terms of costs and eventual revenues and profits.
- Business analysts: They identify the system requirements and align system functionality to business needs.
- Requirements engineers: They identify and document the system requirements.
- Project managers: They track project schedules, budgets, and changes.
- Designers: They design a system's user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and data architectures.
- Architects: They design the system structure, key components, and interactions.
- Programmers: They write the system code.
- Testers and quality assurance: They test the system with respect to functionality and alignment with system requirements.
- Sales and marketing: They sell the system.
- Customer service: They provide customer support for the system.
- Customers: Desire to acquire and use the system.

## Business Analyst

A business analyst (BA) is the individual responsible for gathering the system requirements from the various project stakeholders. In other words, the business analyst must analyze what the system will do and the constraints the system must satisfy.

The business analyst’s tasks:

- Define business requirements
- Plan the requirements approach
- Identify project stakeholders and user classes
- Elicit requirements
- Analyze requirements
- Document requirements
- Communicate requirements
- Lead requirements validation
- Facilitate requirements prioritization
- Manage requirements

## The Project Manager and Project Management Office

Many of the primary reasons why software projects fail can often be traced to poor project management. Therefore, the project manager is the key to any project’s success. The common tasks that a project manager performs include the following:

- Participating in project planning and scope definition: The project manager should be part of the project team early in the project planning discussions. He or she must know the project requirements and avoid scope creep.
- Participating in activity planning and sequencing: The project manager will organize the requirements into executable sequences from which resources (people), budgets, and other activities can be planned.
- Participating in resource planning: The project manager should work with human resources, management teams, and others as necessary to identify the project resources needed. The project manager must then monitor resource performance (people performance), potential changes in staffing needs, and related budget impacts.
- Participating in developing project schedules: The project manager must manage short- and long-term schedules.
- Participating in time estimating: The project manager will work with developers, designers, and managers to estimate the time and resources that each task will require.
- Participating in cost estimating: The project manager will work with developers, designers, and managers to estimate the various costs related to each project task.
- Participating in developing a budget: The project manager will work with managers, finance, and others as necessary to establish a project budget and to monitor the budget throughout the project to ensure that the project remains on track financially.
- Participating in project documentation: The project manager will ensure that all of the required documentation is completed (which may include design documents, project code documentation, and human resources [HR] documentation). The project manager will also track any changes to the project scope.
- Participating in risk analysis: The project manager will track risk factors, such as schedules, costs, changes in scope, and resources, to provide up-to-date risk analytics for the project.
- Monitoring and reporting on project progress: The project manager will track project resources, schedules, tasks, and risks as well as report back to the company leadership accordingly.
- Participating in team leadership: The project manager is a leader with respect to the project team members.
- Representing the business in customer meetings: The project manager will likely have direct access to his or her counterparts on the customer team. In this way, the project manager will represent the project and the company.
- Working with vendors: The project manager may work with vendor who provide people resources, technological resources, and more. In this way, the project manager once again represents the project and the company.
- Participating in quality reviews: The project manager will evaluate the state of the project with respect to quality requirements.
