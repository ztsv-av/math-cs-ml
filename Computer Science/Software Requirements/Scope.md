# Scope

Scope representation defines the system boundaries that are inside of the project and what is outside the project. The scope representation identifies the system context (project implementation) in terms of “is and is not, what it will and won’t do, what it will and won’t contain”. The scope representation is the key project deliverable to get the IT development project off to the right start. The scope must be concise and clear to define “what” is being delivered and not “how.” The product deliverable is represented by one of several techniques. These techniques can include but are not limited to the following:

 - context diagrams;
 - use case diagrams.

A scope can include, but are not limited to, the following key areas:

 - expectation of stakeholders;
 - interfaces of external systems to the project;
 - cost, schedule, and risk to the project;
 - specific limitations or exclusions of the project;
 - input and output of the system or process, dependencies, look and feel of the user interface, as well as security and standards to be followed.

The representation of this information in the scope document will typically make use of the context diagram or the use case diagram or both.

It is critical to have a clear understanding of the limits of the scope. Therefore, to better manage the stakeholders' expectation, a business requirements document should clarify what is out of scope.
