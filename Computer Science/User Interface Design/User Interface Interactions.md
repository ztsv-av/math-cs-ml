# User Interface Interactions

There are 4 types of interactions:

- Instruction
- Conversing
- Manipulating
- Exploring

## Instruction

One of the top uses of a user interface is instruction. There are many applications and Web sites that provide various types of instruction to users. Several different items in a single user interface can provide instruction. For example, a menu asks users to make a selection and then instructs them as to what to do next during the interaction session.

Users interact with an instructional interface similar to the way that they do with a text book, with the exception of videos and audio. What this means is that they process the information in a similar fashion, such as reading from left to right and from top to bottom. However, with an interface, users are normally planning to take some kind of action with the interface. This is interaction. Users will be drawn to instructional items (e.g., menus), as well as buttons, text fields, and other instructional items on the interface.

Think about this type of interaction with the user interface: If a user’s focus is drawn to any aspect of the screen, then he or she will normally continue from that point and move his or her attention to the right and then down. Thus, this must be taken into consideration in the design to draw your user’s attention to the areas where you would like to provide the instructions needed for the interaction session.

As interface functionality increases in complexity, the user interaction design needs to move more toward simplicity. Take for example the following image:

The image on the left has confusing instructions, whereas the image on the right is clear and concise. Because today’s users have experience using interfaces, icons and images can be used for most instruction, but it is always good to add at least a simple instruction to describe what action is needed by the users.

## Conversing

Many modern user interface designs use voice activation. This has become commonplace in hands-free applications, such as automobiles for safety reasons, and many other applications. There are many design aspects that must be considered for this type of interaction, such as the following:

- Consistency
- Intuitiveness
- Clarity
- Responsiveness
- Maintainability

Mobile applications commonly use conversation interaction for their interfaces. Both this one and this one have their own types, as well as home interfaces that users do not see but with which they can converse. This is interesting because it is still interfacing with a computer system, just not visually.

Chatbot is the commonly used term for a program that is used for conversation with a user. This is defined as a way for a computer program to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet.

When designing this type of interface, the designer needs to take into account numerous characteristics of the user who will interface with the program. The first would be personality; as you can tell from various popular conversation interfaces on the market today, they all have a unique personality—that is, they are not all the same, and some even have their own names.

When working with customers in the interaction design, the designer performs the following tasks:

- Outline: This displays all of the several flows and lets the customer know what to expect.
- Flow map: This shows the connection of all of the various flows of the conversation.
- Script: This refers to the primary conversation aspects.
- Main flows: These are the chapters of the script.
- Entry and exit: This will be how the user enters into the conversation and how he or she exits it.
- Catch-all state: All things fail, so this needs to be handled. This also includes providing exceptions for errors.

The following image is a basic example of a user interaction with a mobile device using conversing:

The benefits of using conversing in interfaces include the following:

- Safety
- Hands-free
- Does not require typing or clicking
- Comfort for the user

## Manipulating

With user interactions, there are many direct actions that a user can take on the interaction, such as scrolling, clicking, dragging, and so on. This is termed direct manipulation in user interface design.

Through manipulation, the design will have the user perform the interaction actions that have been mentioned, such as dragging, clicking (pushing a button), and so forth. Instructions or alerts that draw the user’s attention and that provide a sense of urgency can be designed, thus also manipulating the user to take action on something.

All modern user interfaces include different methods of interaction for the user, such as windows, icons, and menus. The way that users interact with these items is direct manipulation. For example, icons use images to draw the user's attention. This describes and categorizes an icon, but it is also a method of manipulation in the user interface.

The following benefits of manipulation are key for consideration:

- Ease of use of the interface
- Ease of learning the interface
- Enjoyable user experience
- Control flow of user interaction

When designing the user interaction, these are some items to keep in mind. The design of icons, menus, and windows should be focused on with regard to drawing the user’s attention to the needed item at the correct time and to control the flow of the overall user interaction session.

Most interfaces have default common icons and components. Users have become accustomed to these and are manipulated by this familiarity and comfort. As a designer—taking into account the operations that are needed in the functionality, especially if abstract—designing icons can be very challenging. Another aspect in the design consideration is whether the design will be relevant in the future.

The Recycle Bin in Microsoft Windows, as shown in the following, is an example of a common icon:

The icon changes to show something in the basket when an item has been deleted. Users may be motivated to empty the Recycle Bin when they see the visual change in the icon.

## Exploring

In user interaction design, usability is designing with the needs of the user in mind, and it is very important in any user interface. The interface needs to allow for the ease of use and to provide an enjoyable user experience. This will then allow for exploration of the interface and all of its connecting pages and interfaces. The interconnection is essential in this aspect.

A hierarchy of interfaces is needed in this design to allow for this exploration and ease of navigation. The primary interface should provide the initial entry point for the user and the instructions for the flow of navigation. The following key items should be considered in the parent page:

- How will the software function?
- What will be provided for the user?
- How will the user navigate the software?
- Are there any rules for the session and interaction of the software?

When thinking about what users will want to do in their interaction session, there are a few steps to consider in the design process. Primarily, these are mapping the scenarios that users will go through, what the flow of exploration will look like, and the actual building of the site mapping. These all fall under navigational aspects and focus on exploring user interfaces.

Other examples of exploring in a user interface would be video games, where the user actually moves through a virtual environment. A virtual environment provides a simulated dynamic interaction with the interface and the environment.
