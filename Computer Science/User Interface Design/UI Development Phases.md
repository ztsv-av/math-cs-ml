# UI Development Phases

Just like any other type of project or programming development, user interface (UI) development undergoes multiple phases, including the following:

- **Planning**
- **Analysis**
- **Design**
- **Development**
- **Testing**
- **Implementation**
  
In addition, there is generally a final **maintenance** phase, which incorporates future enhancements or corrections to the way that the interface is provided.

## Planning

What type of interface are you planning to develop? Is it for a mobile application, a desktop application, or a Web page? There are many things to consider up front. When planning an interface for user interaction, you need to think about several different aspects of design. For example, the following should be considered:

- Audience
- Layout
- Interaction
- Processes

When you determine who will use the interface and on what platform it will be implemented, you can then look at the various steps required for the planning phase of the interface. Think about what components you will need, what the navigational aspects are, what information you will need to provide to the user, and what containers or windows will be used to provide items such as the following:

- Input controls
- Navigational components
- Informational components
- Containers

Your input controls would include items such as buttons, text fields, date fields, and selection items. The selection items would include components such as dropdowns, radio buttons, lists, and toggles. Thinking through the planning aspects of your UI design, you will use multiple components from the aforementioned items. This is where the planning gets more interesting and complex. It is important to keep the interface simple and consistent and to provide the necessary information and functionality without leaving out what needs to be there for your design.

The layout is key to the aesthetics of the design of your interface. It must be purposeful in how it is laid out. Most everyone has encountered an interface that was not intuitive and did not provide the components in areas that made sense. You want the user to have a good experience in his or her interaction with your interface, and you want to eliminate any frustration that the user could encounter.

## Analysis

When completing the initial phases of the planning of your UI, you will want to analyze those decisions. This will get you further toward the actual design of the interface itself. Some of the key aspects of this analysis will be in your review of the components that are selected for the interface. These can be looked at as objects, similar to object-oriented design. What this means is that they each have their own behavior, attributes, and life cycles that need to be carefully considered in the design.

The following are some key items that need to be analyzed in planning interface prior to design:

- Choices: Keep these to a minimum.
- Previews: Choose whether to use small icons or a brief description.
- Entry points: Will users always use the home page, or are there other ways to enter other areas of the application?
- Navigation: Keep this simple, and avoid intermixing many different items; keep them clear and concise.
- Scalability: Prepare your application so that it can be enhanced, as needed.

## Design

The design phase of UI design is multifaceted and covers the following:

- The planning of the interface
- The analysis of that plan to prepare for design
- The design itself
  
The platform and the user need to be at the forefront of design. The layout and the content are important, as is navigation that encourages strong usability.

The design process includes multiple steps to prepare for the actual development, as follows:

1. Sketching: This is where you will convert your hand drawings and any other initial design drawings into an actual sketch of what you would like the interface to look like. An example of an interface sketch is shown in the following:

2. Wireframing: This is a visual representation of the UI. Wireframing differs from sketching in that there will be no visual design elements. You can use wireframing to represent and finalize the hierarchy of the screen components and then define what the users' needs are based on how they will communicate with these components. Some of the key benefits of wireframing in UI design include the following:
- It provides a clear visualization of the interface structure.
- It helps in clarifying the features of the interface.
- It can refine the navigation.
- It provides an iterative process for the design.
- It enhances the effectiveness of the content of the interface.

3. Storyboarding: There are many methods in the user interface design process to aid in the design. One way, especially for Web site development, is to create a storyboard. The storyboard is a visual representation of your design. Storyboarding is a good design tool for use with customer meetings because the visual aspect makes the design more memorable. Also, it is easier to address details. The designerâ€™s role in storyboarding is to provide a scenario description in a visual format.

A simple example of a storyboard for Web site design would be to show the home page and any other pages that it links to in the site. The following is a representation of the basis for a design:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73081144/183811811-a3634f05-c975-4a35-9bfb-dbc77a6ccc86.png)

A more detailed aspect of this storyboard visual would include more details per page. Also, each page of the design would be on a separate page or file of the storyboard with details for that page.

In a similar way, when writing pseudocode for an application prior to coding the application, a storyboard can give the designer a way to draw a rough sketch of how the user interface will look.

In a storyboard, the first step is to layout the initial user interface that the user will see when first interacting with the application. Then, the next user interfaces that will come up in series should be drawn out. This will continue until all of the interfaces that the user will experience are drawn out in the story. The flow of the design is important so that the story is correctly told and can lead to a good design. Again, the storyboard would be a resource for reference.

Some of the key benefits of storyboarding are the following:
- When used in usability testing, it provides feedback on how users react and interact with the design.
- It can aid in the planning of the steps in the usability tests.
- Based on feedback, modifications can be made to the product or the prototype.
- It helps improve usability and experience for the interface users.

4. Prototypes: This is a representation of the UI with which the user can interact. A prototype is not the final product; rather, it can be considered a mock-up of the final product. Prototypes are useful during the design process. The user can explore the planned interface and improve on the requirements for development, and the designer can provide his or her thoughts on each of the interface items. The user can also provide feedback, and the feedback that is received can be used to improve on the overall design or even change directions if needed. An example of a prototype is shown in the following image:

The prototype process follows the steps that are shown in the following figure:

The image below shows the iterations that can be taken to move from what is known as a low-fidelity design to a high-fidelity design in a prototype. The image to the right could possibly be an actual interactive prototype with basic functionality but not the final solution as of yet.

In addition to what has already been mentioned, the following are some more benefits of using prototypes:

- Users can provide feedback based on the design.
- The overall development time is reduced when the prototype is approved.
- Prototypes function as useful reference tools from design through development.
- Customer demands are aligned with what the designer is planning.
