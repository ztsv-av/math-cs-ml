# Conceptial Model

A proof of concept in any design is important to ensure that the concept will work. The difference between the conceptual model and a prototype is that the conceptual model is what you want to convey to the customer or user with regard to the planned design. The prototype, on the other hand, is an early sample or model. The conceptual model is similar to a selling point.

The conceptual model—the user’s perception of the design—will vary. It is a mental model, and it needs to be described in a way that most (if not all) users can envision the final interface design in the same way.

In creating a conceptual model, analysis is key. The analysis needs to include the following:

- What the user will see in the interface
- What the attributes are for each of the objects
- How the user can interact with each object

Keep in mind that the basic components that are part of the build of the interface design are not necessarily needed in the conceptual model. The conceptual model should include the items that the user needs to be primarily aware of.

To review, a conceptual model should include the following:

- The objects that the user will interface with
- The attributes of the objects
- The actions or operations that the user will take on the objects

The benefits of a conceptual model in user interaction design include the following:

- More complete and concise requirements can be obtained.
- Verification and validation of the model can be confirmed.
- Determination about the appropriateness of the model can be established.
- A useful guide for the creation of the prototype is provided.
- 
At a minimum, each conceptual model will include the function and the form that are needed for the user interface and the interaction needed by the user. There are more layers that need to be considered, but function and form are fundamental. Keep in mind that the user interaction includes the screen that the user interacts with and all of the objects or components on each of the screens. The screen will include numerous interaction components.

There is generally more than one screen, so all of the screens need to be connected in some way. This screen connection is the product layer for the conceptual model. The product itself interacts with other products in the same way that the Internet interacts: Multiple servers are communicating with each other. This interaction is another layer for the conceptual model—that is, the system layer.

In summary, the layers in the conceptual model design should include the following:

- Interaction components
- Screen
- Product
- System
