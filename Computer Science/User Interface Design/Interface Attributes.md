# Interface Attributes

The attributes of user interface (UI) design include the following:

- Simplicity
- Clarity
- Consistency
- Familiarity
- Efficiency
- Visual hierarchy
- Responsiveness

## Simplicity

The design of the UI should not be complicated that it discourages users from wanting to use the interface. Designers should perform analyses to determine which items are necessary and which can be excluded or hidden.

Some of the key simplicity principles are the following:

- Making common tasks easier
- Communicating clearly to users
- Providing links that are meaningful and relate to more complex procedures

## Clarity

Clarity is one of the most important attributes of a UI. Tooltips provide explanations to users and therefore bring clarity. In the following example in the Microsoft Word environment, by hovering a mouse over the ribbon item labeled Orientation, a tooltip will display to explain what that item will do:

## Consistency

The entire site needs to be consistent for your users. Repetitive elements can bring consistency and unity to a design.

A good example of UI consistency is the way that Microsoft Office has made each of their application menus or ribbons consistent across a full suite of applications (see the following image). Having the same labeling, placement, and color helps users recognize elements and improves usability.

## Familiarity

When users recognize conventional page design, understand basic labeling, and can act on typical navigation design, they do not have to think. Users should be able to do what they want to do without stopping to figure out what you mean. Most users will not read the page; they will just scan it. Familiar labeling, page layout, and navigation will accomplish this aspect.

Users also benefit from task sequences that are consistent with how they typically do their work, that do not require them to remember information for more than a few seconds, that have terminology that is readily understandable, and that do not overload them with information (HHS, n.d.).

## Efficiency

The efficiency attribute is self-explanatory, but it has some aspects that are worth noting. In designing the efficiency of your interface, consider what needs to be included and what can be left out. In addition, task analysis is a key aspect when thinking about how your users will interact with the interface and the tasks that they want to accomplish.

There are various ways to design the interface so that users can interact with it less frequently. More efficient navigation can be achieved by applying the following:

- Abbreviations
- Hot keys (e.g., function keys)
- Hidden commands
- Macros

## Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is commonly misunderstood and overlooked in UI design. Visual hierarchy is the logical order that designers build into the UI to facilitate user scanning and enhance usability. The most direct way to employ visual hierarchy is by purposefully using size, color, and contrast. For example, headings can help users distinguish titles, topics, and subtopics. The largest type is used for the title, the second largest size is for the main topics, and the third largest size is for the subtopics.

## Responsiveness

A responsive interface relates to two things. First, when users experience fast-loading interface and software, they are more likely to stay with the site. Users should be able to load pages within a few seconds.

Second, users should see feedback, such as a visual change to a button that they clicked or a textual message that indicates that something is loading. (HHS, n.d.)

The following general rules for design are recommended (HHS, n.d.):

- Processing < 10 seconds: Use an hourglass to indicate status.
- Processing > 10 secondsâ€“1 minute: Use a process indicator that shows progress.
- Processing > 1 minute: Tell the user and provide an auditory signal when processing is complete.
