# Design Patters

A design pattern is a common method of designing an interface. 

## Analyzing Patterns

Design patterns have become common in the area of design. There are many design patterns for user interfaces, and the list can become overwhelming; however, it is useful to consider the most common. Choices depend on what the user interface design needs to aid in the design and the solution.

Each design pattern follows rules, which include relationships between specific contexts, a stated problem, and what the solution will be. Because there are common patterns, these rules can be the starting point or the reference points for a design of your user interface. First, the common patterns need to be analyzed to see which one would work in the solution. There are several categories, so you need to find the pattern in the category that matches your planned design.

Some of these categories include the following:

- Getting input or providing output
- Navigation
- Dealing with data
- Content structuring
- Social interaction

When approaching your design, think about what it is that you want to resolve, and then review the details of the common design patterns for that type of solution. For example, if you are focused on obtaining input for a Web site's user interface, then you need to look at a design pattern for forms. There are several form design patterns to review, such as the following:

- Input prompt
- Expandable input
- CAPTCHA

In addition, in this review of a design pattern for user input, there are other areas that should be analyzed, such as explaining the process, which includes patterns known as wizard, completeness meter, Steps Left, and inline help box. The final analysis step is to see how the community drives the design and the needed solution, which would include patterns such as the following:

- Wiki
- Rate content
- Flagging
- Reporting

## Selecting the Right Pattern

Why use a design pattern in the user interface design? It provides a reference point for the design and allows for the focus to be on the innovation and not necessarily on the pattern that needs to be implemented for the solution.

Consistency across user interfaces is also very important, especially in today’s technological world. In addition, using design patterns provides for consistent and correct use of components.

Depending on the solution that has been selected in the user interface design analysis phase, the correct pattern can be chosen. Selecting the right pattern depends on which components you need in your solution and allows for you, as the designer, to make use of available solutions.

For example, in the following image, there are several design patterns on one interface. As aforementioned, there is an overwhelming number of patterns that have been recognized for user interface design, so it is important to review the category of the pattern that you need.

As you can see in this example, there are different aspects of design patterns depending on the context of the interface. There is a tree table pattern for the spreadsheet component, an embedded analytics pattern for the charts and graphs, a contextual actions pattern for interaction, and then a header and search pattern for navigation.

## Pattern Implementation

To implement a selected design pattern, follow the context of the pattern. Design patterns are not complete solutions; rather, they are common structures that can be used in the design, giving users interface designer freedom and flexibility in their innovation.

The levels in applying a design pattern to a user interface design includes the following:

- Implementation
- Flow
- Context

Because design patterns are common structures to interface design, they incorporate prior user experience analysis and what has worked well. Thus, implementing a pattern that has proven to be successful and that has provided a good user experience is beneficial to the design.

To choose the right pattern and implement it, the problem needs to be understood, and the solution needs to be fully comprehended.

In addition, the pattern should fit in the aforementioned three levels—that is, implementation, flow, and context—for the selected design. The designer would then customize the pattern to fit within the other user interface design components, elements, and functions.

As a case study, pick the common user interface design pattern called the Steps Left pattern. This design pattern is commonly used to resolve a problem when a user is required to fill in data over multiple steps.

To implement, a navigation block can be added to the interface. The navigation block describes the steps that the user must follow to enter necessary information into the interface. This navigation block should be persistent on the page, and it should update as the user makes progress through the data input process. Another aspect is that the current step displays as highlighted to let the user know where he or she is, how much he or she completed, and what is left to complete.

The following is an example interface using the Steps Left design pattern for user interface design:

The Steps Left pattern is similar to another design pattern named wizard, which is commonly used. The wizard design pattern guides a user step-by-step through something in a user interface system. Both the Steps Left design pattern and the wizard design pattern fall into the category of getting input or providing output.
